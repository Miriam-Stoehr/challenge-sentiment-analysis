Have its creators made any other shows, mini-series, or movies like it?\n\nFor reference I love Mike Flanagan's work (Haunting of Hill House, Bly Manor, Fall of the House of Usher, which I all recommend) so that is my sort of vibe I like. Any suggestions are welcome!",

Script is the best I\u2019ve heard since. Plot and mechanics are also excellent. Peaky Blinders is just as good.\n\nMasters of the Air is a must see especially for aviation and world war enthusiast like me. The technical details, the execution and the drama. Definitely a gem.\n\nPrison Break could be swapped with Peaky Blinders on some days. The only thing that\u2019s keeping it at 4 is its age, hence the video quality and cinematography. It looks really old compare to Peaky B.\n\nBreaking Bad doesn\u2019t need introduction. Could also be my top 2 easily. Just gives me that \u201cold school\u201d vibe especially since the location was set in NM.\n\nHate me for it, but I take into consideration the overall look and feel.

        "text": "SPOILERS AHEAD (DUH!)\n\nI just watched the Queen's Gambit. Can someone please explain to me what I'm supposed to like about this show? How did this show get such praise and approval?\n\n\u00a0\n\nCharacters were poorly developed and faintly motivated. They also kept randomly popping up and reappearing out of nowhere.\n\nThe acting seemed unnatural. Clich\u00e9s on top of clich\u00e9s.\n\nThe chess portion \u2013 OMG\u2026 I'm someone that barely knows how all the pieces move, and I felt the way the game was portrayed was horribly uninspired. It feels like it was written by someone that never played chess, and only knows it as \"a game for smart people\", and \"oh it's so deep and only smart people understand it\". Sure, if they made it actually complex in a way that would be interesting to chess players, they would rule out like 99.9% of their audience reach, but still.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll continue by just rambling on about random bits and pieces:\n\n\u00a0\n\nBeth's character is introduced in the first scene by being wet, and her first words are \"I'm coming\" \u2013 and if that's isn't fitting of the tone of the whole show\u2026 Her character could be summed up with three words: troubled, smart, pretty.\n\nShe\u2019s missing at least 10-15 minutes EVERY DAY (or so it\u2019s portrayed) cleaning the sponges while she plays with the janitor\u2026. and no one bets an eye on it for MONTHS?\n\nBeltik just randomly re-appears out of nowhere \u2013 THREE TIMES! First when he knocks at her door and later moves in, then at the school where he says he\u2019s concerned about her, and then at the end along with Benny helping her win over \"the Russians\".\n\nJolene also shows up OUT OF NOWHERE.\n\nHer adoptive mother: she\u2019s on and off about being supportive with her playing chess, and then disrupting her away from it. Even when she has a financial incentive for her to succeed, she keeps interrupting her. Oh yeah, such a complex and troubled character as well. Yeah right.\n\nThat French model girl!! Omg\u2026.. \"mais oui, bein sur, je suis une modele, je suis Parisienne and je suis bisexuelle, teehee\". Oh, \"Europeans\"\u2026\u2026 She had to be like 7 French movie tropes/clich\u00e9s all in one. Barf.\n\nBorgov is a very stern and serious looking Russian character. Clich\u00e9y clich\u00e9. Are we back in the 80s?\n\nBorgov and his Russian chess pals don\u2019t close the door when they\u2019re discussing strategy because\u2026 PLOT??\n\nRight after \\^this scene the camera circles around the hotel and we can see inside the rooms through the windows \u2013 and the perspective is oh so bad, it is laughable. It looked like something out of a Wes Anderson movie and was so out of style for the rest of the show. Balcony scenes in Mexico City also had some poor CGI/green screen work.\n\nThat one Russian grandmaster chess player (with long hair and a bear) speaks with a\u2026 German accent? o.0\n\nAll the guys she\u2019s beat effortlessly (or with minimal effort) are giving HER advice over the telephone on how to beat a fckin WORLD CHAMPION. She was supposedly levels above their game, and now they\u2019re of help??\n\nTownes is \u201cthe one that got away\u201d and the one that stole her heart because\u2026 what, he looked deep into her eyes while he was photographing her?? WTF. I thought she was gonna say Beltik or Benny when she was asked about that\u2026. left me so confused. That felt so unexplained. But oh, she\u2019s smart and troubled, so she is complex beyond comprehension.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll in all: totally unconvincing, and left me deflated.\n\nI'm trying to see the other perspective. What did you like about the show?",

I doubt a woman chess grandmaster could beat a male grandmaster for the world title even today.  Who knows why, but AFAIK its not even close.  The show certainly demands suspending some disbelief there.\n\nSometimes the ladies enjoy a little historical empowerment fantasy.  Maybe they don't want to be reminded they were historically second class citizens.  If you wanted to see realistic medieval shows you might see plenty of domestic violence and rampant, even disfiguring disease and infant  death for example.\n\nThere is making  more realistic cinema and there is making the stuff today's audiences want to see.  It's a business.  People don't watch fiction cinema because they want to see reality.  They watch it to see fantasy.  There is accepting reality and there is escaping it with fiction.  As long as you don't confuse the two, it's all good.",

There's also Army of the Dead, but I preferred this prequel more.\n- Ex Machina\n- The Platform\n- Get Out\n- Extraction 1 & 2\n- The Old Guard\n- The Gray Man\n- The Ritual\n- Edge of Tomorrow",

I\u2019m saying this out of a place of love and not negativity, but it takes a special kind of person to be with somebody like us not because we\u2019re less because they immediately have to look past a few selfish things to really invest enough to develop that kind of connection.

        "text": "OK real talk; she's pretty picky.\n\nMy mom is much more conservative than I, she really *dislikes sex scenes and language*. I literally check the Parent's Guide for each show, though sometimes it's not super accurate. \n\nShe enjoys **mystery**, **thrillers**.. big Law & Order fan, Chicago Fire.. whatever. I however don't care for those shows but I do enjoy mystery/**crime** with her.\n\nIf it's complicated like time travel or too many characters she will lose interest and just read while I watch it lol, so it's been tricky coming up with a show every week or so, we usually watch a couple hours on the nights my dad works. it's a good bonding time even when I have to explain the plot and characters every episode. (i do love my mom i promise)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.serializd.com/user/RyanABXY/profile](https://www.serializd.com/user/RyanABXY/profile)\n\nI've seen a lot, my tastes are def different than hers, but in terms of Netflix, here's ones we both enjoyed or least didn't hate:\n\n* Queen's Gambit\n* School Spirits\n* Erased\n* Love on the Spectrum (US+Australia)\n* My Lover My Killer\n* American Nightmare\n* Escaping Twin Flames\n\nI only really got into reviewing everything since November, so there's lots we watched, and plenty we didn't like or fell out of love with. Also, many many movies but we prefer shows so I'm focusing on that\n\nlook at my profile if you're curious if I've watched it. I've seen a lot that she hasn't :)\nEDIT: I'm almost 40 and she's almost 70 if that helps. ",

There are definitely better episodes to start with if she's unsure - deffo avoid the one where the politician has sex with a pig lol\n\nSince she likes docuseries about scandals / cults / crimes, try out\n- Icarus - documentary about a cyclist who wants to document an experience doping and ends up unravelling the Russian gymnastics doping scandal\n- Keep Sweet: Pray & Obey - I watched this right after I watched this right after Escaping Twin Flames because I couldn't think anything could be more messed up... I was wrong. Fair warning It is about the FLDC cult leader if religion is a touchy subject\n\n++ if you have Hulu / Disney+\n- Wild Crime - docuseries about murders in American national parks. There are a few seasons\n- Only Murders in the Building - dramedy that satires true crime podcasts / series. My parents both love it. There may be sex in a few scenes but super minor part of the show\n\nAlso I saw in your watch list you've watched kdramas - does she like those too or nah?",

Harmon, Borgav, hell the match vs Beltik in Kentucky took place in fucking Latvia in 1955! The final match vs Borgav in \u201cRussia\u201d took place in Switzerland in 1993!\n\nThere were so many \u201cclues\u201d I thought would be later plot points like the KGB watching and \u201ca sign from Borgav\u201d would mean he was going to defect later and the Queen\u2019s Gambit was a metaphor for how she\u2019d help him escape. Or how poisoning one player\u2019s tea meant they would do that to her.\n\nNope.\n\nTotal fiction loosely based on the idea if Bobby Fischer was a girl.\n\nI\u2019m so fucking annoyed.\n",

Suddenly, Claire is transported to 1743 and into a mysterious world where her freedom and life are threatened. To survive, she marries Jamie Fraser, a strapping Scots warrior with a complicated past and a disarming sense of humour. A passionate relationship ensues, and Claire is caught between two vastly different men in two in harmonious lives. `Outlander' is adapted from the best-selling books by Diana Gabaldon.\n\nI highly recommend it!!",

Actually doesn't need to be romance and drama only, am willing to try others!\n\nSome shows I really really enjoyed are: True blood, Wednesday, Witcher S1, game of thrones, money heist, love island, suits (until it got boring), designated survivor, Bridgeton, next in fashion, emily in Paris, mind hunter, the last kingdom, queen's gambit, bodyguard, sex life.\n\nI'm currently watching dynasty and it is a little boring. Dahmer is a bit too dark for my mood. Also on s7 of blacklist and it is kinda slow and repetitive. \n\nPlease help! What else should I watch?",

Might have to rethink this. (Also, would like to see the second season of Mo when it appears).\n\nNetflix was great at what it does, so good that other services copied their success and scooped up a lot of content. Oh well.\n\nPersonally I wasn't upset about them cancelling some of their original series, the ones that I've seen that were cancelled I didn't feel strongly about (we liked Inside Job). \n\nAt their best they were great. Our three original faves: Bojack, The Get Down, and Queen's Gambit.\n\n(for now we're tryin Disney, recommending: Atlanta and Reservation Dogs)",

The clinic offers Netflix as a distraction while the magnetic pulses tap away at my cerebral cortex.  \n\nI am trying to find shows that have minimal sexual content and limited swearing bc there's a facilitator in the room and I don't want to feel uncomfortable about content.\n\nI finished The Queen's Gambit today, which was - perfect - for this situation.  We also watched The Midnight Club.  I've got 30 days of treatment left.  \n\nWhat should I watch next? :)",

Just as there was US teamwork for the last game, maybe there'll be US teamwork in developing 9LX.\n2. Also in the series finale, there's a line about [endgames](https://redd.it/wpvusw):\n\n>If they play on, once the dust settles and the endgame emerges, she could find herself in a very different position. Borgov is death on endgames. He\u2019s famous for it. Harmon, on the other hand, is not. She\u2019s more known for coming up early and strong, demoralizing her opponents from the start.\n\n**Maybe someone like Borgov** who's 'death on endgames' would come up with something.\n\nxlury3, xlurxc, xlurtv, xlva6x, xm7f63, xm7gor",

You sometimes get odd Korean humor that doesn't overstay it's welcome however.\n\nKingdom is a really well done and super entertaining Korean zombie horror in a medieval setting with 2 seasons I believe.\n\nPersonally, Sweet Home (manwha adaption) is like a guilty pleasure to me. You could technically call it the \"low budget Resident Evil\" of Korea... \n\nAnother Korean show, which is very popular at the moment, is called Extraordinary Attorney Woo.\n\nI'd just try any of the Korean shows pretty much. If you like fantasy as much as you say you do, try the Chinese series Handsome Siblings. It has for China typical martial arts. This show became one of my favorites. The Legend of White Snake is similar, but more focused on Romance, but still has great action and drama.",

The Queen's Gambit is one of the most respected and timeless openings in chess.",

It was like a long-ass movie. And if they wanna make another season god knows when nobody would complain too much, but the point is it doesn't need a second season.  \n\n\nI'm tired of the cool quirky, offbeat, super fun shows getting canned, and those stories are just gone forever.  \n\n\nMake them all Limited Run, and if one of them does turn out to be the next Squid Game, then ffs just make a second season or spinoff to keep the cash flow.  \n\n\n  \nI literally can't get excited about new shows anymore, I've been hurt too many times. I'm literally watching Bullsh!t because it's fun and I know I have nothing to lose by getting invested.",

And with so many cancelled after 1 or 2, I'd lean heavily toward 1. Just as you say, make a long movie. Maybe the ideal would be a long movie that has a beginning, middle, and definite end... but somehow could be added onto or continued if desired.

We expect a minimum of 9 episodes.\"\n\n80% of estimated viewership results in a 20% budget cut and an minimum of eight episodes, etc, and the same formula applies all the way down to 40%.\n\nIf a show gets below 40% of its estimated viewership, then its second season is limited to one feature-length movie. I.e., 30% of estimated viewership allows for a $15 million budget for an 80-minute movie.\n\nIf the \"second season\" gets below 100% of the new, revised viewership estimate, then the show is canceled.

Once you've seen one of the best it's hard to watch the second-rate stuff. \n\nMaybe they'd be better off just being overall average? That way expectations are not raised and the terrible stuff does not look so bad by comparison. It seemed to work well for network TV, where everything was okay but nothing was great.",

You thus have great self-contained story arcs with very little fat to trim and no loose ends. Moreover, unlike US 12+ episode seasons, the UK's focus on fewer episodes means that a single writing team could do the whole show run. That meant you didn't have \"filler episodes\" or \"guest writer\" episodes that could result in a drastic change of tone or inconsistency. (See a couple of Friends episodes to see this in action, there are guest-written episodes that feel like a Benny Hill physical comedy routine instead of wry observational humor.)\n\nThis is also not a new thing, for British TV, either. As long ago as 1979, they made Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a self-contained six-part TV series. They knew they were making something very complex, very gradually-paced, and likely to be ignored by the majority of the viewership for being too difficult and indirect.\n\nThen guess what happened? There was a writer's strike. Suddenly, Tinker Tailor was the only reliable ongoing show for the six weeks of its run. Millions tuned in to this complex, sophisticated spy narrative, and the BBC had an unexpected popular hit - after fully expecting it to appeal only to the \"puzzle solvers\" among the viewership.",

From recollection the last movies I remember watching are all of Tarantinos films up to Django, Moneyball, Queens Gambit - I\u2019m sure there are a few more that I can\u2019t remember. What are some all time greats from the past 10 years or so I should watch? Drama/suspense with a good fast moving storyline and acting. All time favorite series are Dexter, Breaking Bad (oh I did watch El Camino also), Peaky Blinders, etc.",

Hopefully it's accessible in Europe too, not just US. It doesn't have to be English speaking.\n\nTV Shows that I've **loved** & watched until the end:\n\n* Fargo !!! (and the Movie)\n* The Serpent !\n* Godless !\n* Sinner\n* Vikings (especially the first seasons!)\n* True Detective!\n* Oz\n* Money Heist (especially the first seasons!)\n* Unbelievable\n* Dexter\n* The Wire\n* Queen's Gambit\n* Dr. House\n* Battlestar Galactica '04\n* Dracula '20 (better than it seems)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMovies that I've **loved**\n\n* **No Country for Old Men**, True Grit, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (big fan of the Coen Bros style)\n* The Usual Suspects, **The Game '97**, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Red Dragon, Grand Hotel Budapest (like Wes Anderson's work), Fracture, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (seen almost all Guy Ritchie made)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm still watching, like them so far, will reach a conclusion once they are done\n\n* The Witcher (maybe just because I enjoyed the game)\n* Sopranos\n* Deadwood\n* Boardwalk Empire\n* Mindhunter\n* Raised by the Wolves\n* Lost (way overdue)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I think is meh or tried and it didn't stick with me (it's just my opinion, sorry)\n\n* The OA (once the story got going it wasn't as convincing to me)\n* Breaking Bad (interesting at first but lost interest as it went on)\n* Squid Game (I know, unpopular opinion, sorry, it was just OK to me)\n* Ozark, Narcos, Lucifer, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot (Love Remi, but this show was meh for me), The Leftovers (this setting just felt silly) + other popcorn or brain dead stuff in general",

It\u2019s why you see uninspired, formulaic approaches like what Chuck Lorre offers for big networks, or why awful reality shows or soap operas pull huge numbers (again with minimal cost). Those are low risk shows that offer big returns.  It\u2019s why McDonald\u2019s and Subway are two of the biggest restaurants in the world. It\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the same rehashed crap released by Hollywood over and over. You\u2019ll find that Reddit is not at all a reflection of the general public, and so shows praised on here may very well be nixed by the viewers, because most people still just like drivel.",

Originally, I thought that Nvidia was doing some debanding that solved the issue, but I think it's a bug since afterwards you can set it back to the original setting and the issue will stay fixed. However the issue comes back after reboots, so I just have left it on 1% for now. \n\nAfter this, it is fixed ->  [Fixed Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540641109802483724/871490906677731328/image0.jpg) It still looks a bit banded in the image, but I think that's just the camera, looked great in person.\n\nI'm curious if this is an issue for everyone, and if so if I should be reporting it to Netflix or Nvidia. It's been driving me crazy for a while now, so I'm glad I've figured it out. All of my friends are able to reproduce it, so I don't believe it's just me. Additionally, looking at the same episode via other sources the issue doesn't occur, so it seems to be just via the official Netflix app or Edge.",

I think the show is absolutely f'ing terrible but I can't quit watching it)\n\nQueen's Gambit\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nTried Dark a few times, just couldn't get into it.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nMindhunter\n\nSex Education\n\nCobra Kai\n\n13 Reasons Why(only watched the first season, I thought it was actually pretty good but had no interest in going forward)\n\nUnbelievable\n\nStranger Things\n\nPrefer darker shows, especially crime type stuff.",

It takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where Titans (large, man-eating creatures) dominate the world and the remaining population is forced to live within three walls for safety. Then, one day, there was a breach in the outermost wall, threatening mankind's existence once more. \n\nThe world-building and the interconnection of every season are next level, and you'll definitely be left thinking about how the previous episodes/seasons affect the next. The later seasons get pretty heavy (in terms of lore and topics) which I feel might suit your interests :D",

Something that has different, fresh storyline yet intriguing which makes it stands out with lack of romance, not a typical one. More about plotting on a good-mind strategy, any genres is welcome, (movie/tv series). I don\u2019t mind with political plot or in dystopian era. Does cobra kai has similar sense to it. Is it good? \n\nThank you for your suggestions. I really appreciate it :)",

Love movies too. \n\nThank you!",

I do currently have a bunch of time on hand but I'm still in a stressful situation and would like something that takes me out of it in the evening - doesn't have to be spiritual or anything and I don't mind depressing shows per s\u00e9, as long as it's immersive.  \n\n\nSome shows that did that for me exceptionally well in the past are:  \nLost (by far the best for this kind of situation)  \nTwin Peaks  \nThe Wire  \nThe Killing  \nGame Of Thrones  \nThe Walking Dead (when I binged it S1-S5 approx. but I've read the comics and was super thrilled to get into the show)  \n\n\nOther shows I've already seen (some of which I'd rank higher than the ones above, but didn't meet that one criteria I'm looking for):Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, La Casa De Papel, Luther, Goliath, Dark, Stranger Things, Fargo, Peaky Blinders, (The Walking Dead), Fear The Walking Dead, The Leftovers (disappointed with this one, still a good show though), Chernobyl, Queen's Gambit, The Sopranos and some I probably forgot about already.\n\nI'm currently eyeing Ozark and The 100, but neither convinces me to start the binge immediately. I'd love some recommendations to check out. On Netflix would be great, but it's not a killer criterium.",

Queen's Gambit is world class and deserves to win every award this year.  The final episode is the best TV I have ever seen in my life.  I can watch it over and over.\n\nHilda ties with Mushishi (you can watch it on Hulu) as the best animated series ever made.  It'll suck you in no matter your age.  It has very profound, moving story arcs, and the characters all have episodes focused on them.  It's not just about Hilda.  The entire world is so fully fleshed out, it's a place you can wrap your mind around.  \n\nRussian doll is a mind bending rollercoaster ride with a trippy ending.  Episodes are short, you can easily binge it in one evening (about 3 hours total)\n\nDo Queen's Gambit and Hilda for sure.  You won't regret either.  Netflix has got to do more stuff like this, because there's nothing else on the service at that high level of quality.\n\nHope you find se.good stuff to watch!",

Or the ending is uncertain which keeps the audience watching more episodes. The Crown is historical fiction and based on the life of Queen Elizabeth but we know the queen is fine right now (as of writing). So where is the climax? Is there like one event in the queens life the show is building up-to? What is everything building upto? \n\nOr is The Crown just an inside look at how the royal family operates? Putting out fires wherever they pop up, not really building up-to anything but super interesting nevertheless?\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nTL;DR I feel like the crown is an excellent show that might not have a climax and it\u2019s discouraging me from watching more episodes.",

It's semi-autobiographical and the queen is still alive and well, so no amount of embellishing and building tension can truly convince you that everything isn't gonna turn out just fine in the end concerning her. And there's nothing abnormal about feeling a little disenchanted as a result of that. Some historical adaptations can get away with it a bit more because we weren't there in those days, for example The Tudors series. Personally, I avoided adaptations about WACO and the show Narcos because I had already watched many documentaries and read many articles about them long before those series were ever a thing. I also steered clear of most movies about 9/11. Not just because I thought it was somewhat tasteless that the industry jumped on a bandwagon to capitalize on such a tragedy so soon, but also because they aren't really offering anything you don't already know if you were alive and saw it all go down in real time. When you take the suspense out of something and replace it with predictability, it can make it much less interesting for you. Like you said. It can certainly still be interesting, perhaps intriguing getting a glimpse into a royal life, but without suspense, it can feel disenchanting.",

In the same vein, I\u2019m discouraged from watching anything about the coronavirus (Totally Under Control). If something cool came out about the recent drama/events surrounding Meghan Markel and the royal family, I would watch that because I think I could learn more about that series of events. I liked Narcos because it was before my time and based on something that I\u2019ve heard about and seen before but didn\u2019t really know anything about (Pablo Escobar).",

        "text": "I generally prefer TV shows to movies. I don't like horror.\n\nHere are a list of TV shows I've watched and my quick rating of them. These are just my opinions, everyone will have different tastes. I outline my ratings for multiple reasons. \n\n- So you know which shows I've watched as to not recommend.\n\n- The ratings serve to show which shows I enjoy, so please recommend shows that are similar to the ones that I rated highly. \n\n- Same as number two, but reversed- maybe you'll take away a recommendation if we have overlapping tastes. \n\nNo direct spoilers involved, but I do list cancelations when I know about them and sometimes I comment on what parts of the show were good/bad including endings, without revealing specifics.\n\n#Action\n\n- Breaking Bad **(9/10)**\n\nBasically a classic.\n\n- The Umbrella Academy **(8.5/10)**\n\nSecond season was better than the first, and the first was already good! I don't know if they can keep topping it but worth the watch for now.\n\n- Stranger Things **(8/10)**\n\nGreat first season, but I see the show getting worse with each subsequent season. \n\n- The 100 **(7.5/10)**\n\nNew enemies become allies when there's a newer enemy. Rinse and repeat for 5 seasons. I stopped at season 6.\n\n- The Witcher **(7.5/10)**\n\nA bit overhyped by people who already wanted to watch it. Getting a sense of time and geography felt missing.\n\n- The Walking Dead **(7/10)**\n\nGreat at the start and it tampers off with the plot getting repetitive.\n\n- Jessica Jones **(7/10)**\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed it but I can see how it's not for everyone. Season 2 doesn't always make sense.\n\n- The Colony **(5/10)**\n\nI enjoyed the time watching it but the plot didn't have a lot of room for growth and it got canceled. \n\n- Merlin **(3/10)**\n\nEnding was bad. King Arthur was a brat undeserving of any kind of legacy. Wtf is this even?\n\n#Dramas\n\n- This Is Us **(10/10)**\n\nIf you like soapy dramas, watch this. You'll find a character you love. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like that genera.\n\n- Dirty John **(9/10)**\n\nLoved it. Based on true stories. Good dose of empathy and reality IMO. \n\n- Broadchurch **(9/10)**\n\nMurder mystery that relies more on plot and sleuthing than a draw to gore. Second season is good as well. \n\n- Afterlife **(9/10)**\n\nFunny and sad take on grief and depression. \n\n- Living with Yourself **(8.5/10)**\n\nEver wondered what the best version of yourself looks like? What would you be if you did everything right? Good concept done well.\n\n- Queen's Gambit **(8.5/10)**\n\nI'm glad it's only 10 episodes, this is exactly the kind of thing that needed to be longer than a movie, but not stretched over multiple seasons. \n\n- Black Mirror **(8.5/10)**\n\nSome episodes are better than others. \n\n- The End of The F***ing World **(8/10)**\n\nGreat show, strong second season tying into the first.\n\n- Better Call Saul **(8/10)**\n\nDon't expect Breaking Bad, but it's still great.\n\n- You **(8/10)**\n\nPretty good.\n\n- Jane the Virgin **(8/10)**\n\nA catholic virgin gets accidentally artificially inseminated. It's a love triangle/square/octagon depending on the season. It makes fun of telanovella tropes. Great at the start, the last season seemed a bit lazy. Soapy.\n\n- Insatiable **(7.5/10)**\n\nThe ending frames everything you've watched slightly differently without a plot twist. Good drama. It's about beauty pageants but they're the background to the drama. Soapy, kinda.\n\n- Orange is the New Black **(7.5/10)**\n\nUps and downs with the plot. While it was intended to be political, the reality of prison life is actually also very depressing, and considering this is drawn out over multiple seasons, it's actually kind of taxing to watch even if I enjoyed it.\n\n- Gilmore Girls **(7.5/10)**\n\nMy most rewatched show on Netflix. The more I watch it the less I like it, so I had to stop. I don't know that I'd recommend it unless you've started.\n\n- Suits **(7/10)**\n\nBetter in early and midseasons than the end. \n\n- Russian Doll **(6.5/10)**\n\nGroundhog day premise with an ending I didn't like. Good concept, not a huge fan.\n\n- Wentworth **(6.5/10)**\n\nOrange is the New Black but Australian. Less comedy. I'd cut the last season.\n\n- Dead to Me **(6/10)**\n\nWatch it if you have nothing else to watch. Kinda like Good Girls.\n\n- Outlander **(6/10)**\n\nInteresting concept but too much sadism for the type of romantic-drama it was.\n\n- Sherlock **(6/10)**\n\nI'm tired of the genius sociopath narrative, even though this was popular for it's time.\n\n- Good Girls **(6/10)**\n\nI liked the side characters more than the protagonist and the plot was a bit dry. But it's got some humour.\n\n- Virgin River **(5/10)**\n\nI enjoyed it more than my rating reflects, but I know it's not for everyone. The plot isn't strong. I think I'm unconsciously rating it higher because the wide open shots of nature made me feel nice while watching it.\n\n- Blackmirror Bandersnatch **(5/10)**\n\nFun to tinker with for 20 minutes to an hour, but a lot of the endings don't make sense. Constantly operating the remote detracts from enjoyment fast.\n\n- Sex Education **(5/10)**\n\nGood premise but as a woman in her mid20s, I felt out of place watching teenagers give each other sex advice. Some humour. I can't really conceptualize who the target audience is intended to be.\n\n- Glitch **(4/10)**\n\nA great concept butchered. Plotholes galore. Mixing science and magic for a confusing plot. It was canceled to boot so we don't get to have answers. Don't start watching.\n\n#Comedies/Sitcoms\n\n\n- BoJack Horseman **(10/10)**\n\nNo show has ever prompted me to look at my relationships with other people as much. Animated sitcom, not anime. Most of the comedy comes from animal puns.\n\n- Scrubs **(8/10)**\n\nIt was pretty funny and heartfelt at times. Some really great episodes. The will-they-won't they romance in it is kinda garbage, but that's not why I watched it.\n\n- Archer **(8/10)**\n\nSitcom. Relies on vulgarity, crassness and repetition for comedy but it's almost always fun.\n\n- The Good Place **(7.5)**\n\nI'm actually currently watching it. Seems like a feel good comedy for the most part.\n\n- Santa Clarita Diet **(7.5/10)**\n\nOff-beat comedy with zombies. Lots of gore but not in a scary way. Probably the best zombie comedy, but it got canceled, so without an ending and some answers to questions, I can't give it a higher rating even though I really want to.\n\n- The Office **(7/10)**\n\nAn intentionally banal sitcom that replaces the classical laugh track with the main character staring deadpan into a camera. It's got some cringe, it's got some great punchlines. The plot and characters are ok. It's good but it's not great.\n\n- Friends **(5.5)**\n\nA bit nostalgic since I was growing up with my parents watching it. I don't have anything specifically positive to say about it, and that's the show's biggest problem.\n\n- How I Met Your Mother **(4/10)**\n\nCouldn't even finish. About a guy who loves love more than the women he supposedly loves. Like Friends, I don't think this would be funny without a laugh track. \n\n------------------\n\nHappy to chat about ratings as long as it's civil. I suspect the How I Met Your Mother rating will ruffle some feathers.\n\nBased on what I've watched and what I enjoyed, what would you recommend?\n\nI will likely not enjoy horror, reality TV, kids stuff or anime.\n\nI'm iffy about crime or medical shows because they usually seem like long investments that don't pay off as well as other shows. Definitely open to fantasy or sci fi, but I won't start things like star trek that will take forever.",

Also Kim's Convenience and Workin' Moms are 2 other Canadian sitcoms that I found funny & enjoyable.  I also just finished \"Girlfriends\". Took me a couple episodes to get into it and once I did I got hooked on the individual character story lines. \n\nI tend to agree with your opinion of How I Met Your Mother. It was meh. \n\nModern Family is another one that I really enjoyed. \n\nI started to watch The Good Place but it didn't catch my interest after about 4 episodes. Perhaps I should give it another go, as I'm currently looking for something to watch.",

                "comment_text": "Maniac- similar in tone to Russian Doll, some of the overarching techy themes are similar to Black Mirror, but overall a really original and beautiful show. Set in an alternate (and very 80s-esque) timeline New York City, two individuals (Jonah Hill and Emma Stone) join the same trial for an experimental drug. Each episode has a contained story in a new setting as part of the drug trial, but the through-lines of relationships, the pasts of each character, and the people running the drug trial are amazing. Sometimes campy, sometimes creepy, always very emotionally real, funny, and inventive. One of my favorite shows.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend- Great comedy if you liked the earlier seasons of Jane the Virgin. A high-powered NYC lawyer with mental health issues drops everything to move to small-town California to pursue her teenage crush. The songs are hilarious and it satirizes the rom-com and musical tropes in a similar manner to how early Jane the Virgin treats telenovela tropes. A good mix of smart comedy and honest plot.\n\nArrested Development- Final two seasons really fall off but the first three are some of the best sitcom episodes ever. A formerly wealthy family has to move into a model home together after their father gets sent to prison. The one sane family member has to try and keep everything afloat while dealing with his ridiculous siblings and parents. One of the funniest shows out there, great use of narration.\n\nGLOW- One of the most underrated Netflix Originals (imo). Based around the true story of a female wrestling group in the 80s. A real ensemble comedy, every character is so fleshed out and interesting and they all get their moment. Very diverse, especially considering the time period it\u2019s set in. Super fun and quick to watch.\n\nDerry Girls- Set in Northern Ireland during the troubles. Sometimes feels similar to Sex Education and TEOTFW (maybe just because they all have UK teens), but much lighter and less raunchy. Just a genuinely funny show.\n\nI Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson- Absolutely ridiculous sketch show. Consistently funny and sometimes surreal.\n\nFeel Good- Very quick watch, good mix of sharp comedy and human drama. About the relationship between a lesbian standup battling addiction and her girlfriend who\u2019s never dated women before. Good queer relationship dynamics without the conflict of the show being centered on the fact that the characters are queer.",

I wish I could watch it again and again if it would never get boring.\n\nAnyway, while I was showering I had a somewhat-eureka moment. I was thinking a prequel about her biological mother, Alice Harmon, and her mathematics career could be very interesting if it\u2019s made with the same vibe as The Queen\u2019s Gambit. I was intrigued when I saw the particular scene which briefly shows her dissertation on \u201cMonomial Representations and Symmetric Presentations\u201d. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a real thing in mathematics but it made me very curious about her mother.\n\nWhat do you think? Should there be any prequel based on that idea?",

The costuming is great and does a nice job of borrowing from the period while not underwhelming the actors. The chess is pretty accurate. \n\nSo, let\u2019s break down the rest. Jolene is a token character who did her job. The movie isn\u2019t a out Jolene and were her role more realistic, the conversation and criticism would\u2019ve overwhelmed the narrative. \n\nThe narrative is a female Bobby Fisher. Fortunately, one doesn\u2019t need a real life female chess grandmaster to pattern after, but in that area, while a men\u2019s game, it was not a men\u2019s only club. Just as sciences and engineering are dominated by men today, there are still women who work and compete and are equal to men in every aspect of every industry. This was true in chess as well. \n\nI\u2019m guessing, as I\u2019m currently reading the book, that Walter Tevis was, in part, putting on display the problems often associated with genius in a highly focused area with the use of drugs and alcohol as a medium of humanizing Beth while also acting as an illustrative example of what one who is self-destructive goes through. \n\nCould Tevis have chosen a man? Sure. Would it have worked as well? Probably not. The first step was to insist upon a suspension of disbelief and then to allow for an orphan to rise up and stand out. There are supporting characters, again of which Jolene is one, who support that journey as well as the transformations and transitions. More to the point, the show goes to great lengths to illustrate men who have gone the path we watch Beth follow. \n\nWhere is it all meant to lead us? \n\nWhat\u2019s unfortunate is the need for everything the represent every possible scenario in a way that feels good today. While uncomfortable, the show helps us to see the inequalities in the modern world as well as in the United States right now. That you cannot accept Beth as a possible grandmaster in the 1960s would further suggest you don\u2019t understand the movements of the era, equal rights, civil rights, and the explosion of sexual equality. \n\nYou\u2019re not required to like the series or the book or what it represents. But even a passive observer of the show should\u2019ve seen even older examples of women who competed at the highest levels of chess. \n\nFor me, the show is a nice, even, slow burn that satisfies in a way few movies or tv shows do. But that\u2019s me. And my take on history is not yours.",

                "comment_text": "This show made little sense to me. Externally, Elizabeth is motivated to win chess because she wants/needs money. Internally, she likes to be good at something, wants to feel in control. There's a tiny bit of backstory/context, and we're also supposed to presume that as a prodigy, she was quite bored by most all else life could offer her as a child at an orphanage. And yet, her character stops transforming after childhood.\n\nShe meets people and has her first sexual experience, but it doesn't change her. She starts doing other drugs and drinking, but it doesn't change her. Her mother dies, but it doesn't change her. She gets that nice guy to live with her, and for a moment there are hints that she may be receiving something she needs from him, but when she pushes him away and he leaves, there is no response or change in direction. My willful suspension of disbelief stretches far enough to cover this alternate reality in which chess is the most exciting thing ever, but not nearly far enough to make me believe Elizabeth as a character.\n\nNot to mention, I forgot, losing money she bet doesn't seem to bother her. There is no conflict at her own frivolous spendings, despite us being told of her being motivated to play, in part, for money, and having grown up as someone who had nothing. She NEEDS to win the $100 and not the $25 in her first tournament, etc. And the building blocks of her internal motivation don't hold up either. She gains enough life experience to be able to relax and let go, to welcome a loss, for example, because she realizes she has a place outside of the chess board in the world now. But her relationship to chess remains static.\n\nThere is so much more to say, honestly. At the end of the day, this isn't an action thriller, a series of sequential chess tournaments is not enough \"plot\" to distract from the fact that the character isn't changing, and this is something the writers must have been aware of thanks to a sprinkling of many events that have the POTENTIAL to transform her--but don't (with no explanation/it doesn't feel like her NOT changing was the intention).\n\nAnd unrelated, but I also noticed when her adopted mom sent her to buy three packs of cigarettes, she only got one (but returned home with three). And when she went to play late-night speed chess, it looked like the guy that was supposed to get her coffee didn't actually take the cup out of her hand (but she's seen without a cup after that).\n\nA lot of these Netflix Originals are the equivalent of fast food. They have tried to milk the motif of chess into a plot, but it doesn't hold up. The premise just isn't executed in a believable manner--what if an orphan girl child prodigy shook up 1960s world of chess? Well, okay! Where are the consequences?! What are the conflicts this child has to face? What does she lose? What does she gain? It would be so much more interesting if these questions were truly answered. I can't help but think of the contrast between the execution of this story and Rain Man, which to me has an equivalent premise. Of course, the story of Rain Man is holistically born OF the premise, rather than being tacked onto it. \n\nOtherwise, good acting, good costumes, entertaining scenes/visuals for the most part.",

                "comment_text": "SPOILERS:\n\nFor me, the biggest problems were that there was no chararacter arc in the story and all the chess lingo, professional chess player behaviour and the bord action that sucked big time for me as a chess enthusiast\n\nLets start with the chess stuff:\n\n1 Like, Harmon is supposed to be this Paul Morphy kind of player but that style of chess died 50 years before she took the stage and there is a reason Mikhail Tall was only a champion for 1 year even though his style is somewhat similar to that of Beth Harmon. It's fucking hard to attack, attack, attack against chess grandmasters! They know how to defend and counter threats on the chess board! \n\n2. Moscow tournament didn't make any sense because if Borgov was a WC he would not play in the candidate tournament because that's the place other challengers go to fight for the chance to play the WC.\n\n3. Chess grandmasters are always talking about basic tacticts and strategies. \"You do that and he doubles your pawns\" Really?? You got to say that to an aspiring chess WC contender? Hard to imagine Spassky would need such advice because the guy was probably thinking 3000 levels deeper than that. \n\n4. Throwing kings as a sign of resining is also a cringy \"only in films\" type of move, real chess players never do that. \n\n5. Banter during games is sooo bad, players do not even look at each other during games, let alone converse. Kasparov is an exception. \n\n6. No draws, ever. It doesn't even come up until the final episode that that is also a regular thing that happens in chess. \n\nAs far as the story goes here are a couple of my questions that i feelt were not answerd:\n\n\n1. Why is her mom insane and why didn't she try to contact her real dad when she got more older in an effort to find out more?\n\n\n2. Is Townes gay? What's up with that whole story line?\n\n\n3. Why bring back Harry Beltick, the guy we see in one scene for 15 seconds 4 episodes ago? Like, he is such a vanilla dude and i don't see what the fuck he brings to the table story wise.\n\n\n4. Mr. Scheibel, the most important person in her life after her mother is a completely forgotten chararacter all the way up to the last episode.\n\n\n5. Joylen, the token black bff, also gone. But let's watch Harry Beltick's pale limp dick get screen time talking absolut chess  nonsense, his aspirations and dental problems.\n\n\n6. Does she want to be an extravagant Parisian model or a down-to-earth sort of girl that plays chess with old men in the park? I don't get it.\n\n\n7. What's up with her not taking money from the church ladies? Is she secretly communist? I mean i wouldn't mind it, just fucking explain it please so it's not just that \"i am a hard nose bitch that aint doing nothing if i don't 100% agree with it\" like, you need the money girl, say whatever is needed, get the bag and fly to fucking Moscow. \n\n\nOn the plus side, really liked the costumes, production design and the cinematography,  it's an ok show for waisting time i guess",

It was a 60's period piece porn, and I liked that. \n\nI also was raised by an addict, and I felt like the show's mood swings really capture what it is like for an addict to try to stay away but fall back in.  \n\nHowever...to everyone's points above.  The character of Jolene was so cringe.  Did the pilot not test well because it was too white so they wrote her in?  The conversation about her being the guardian angel was so problematic.  Also her lending her $3,000 is absolutely ridiculous.  No way. How could the writers be this lazy?\n\nSomething I haven't heard anyone else mention is WHY THE FUCK IS HARRY IN BENNY'S NYC APT TALKING OVER CHESS STRATEGY FOR MOSCOW???\n\nHarry is a student/grocery store assistant manager IN KENTUCKY.  Benny had no idea who Beth was in Vegas after she beat Harry and won the Kentucky championship, and she has novelty because she is THE ONLY STUNNING REDHEAD IN THE ROOM, so there's no evidence Benny would have any idea who Harry was.

You mention all these movement that \u201cdon\u2019t change her.\u201d I agree that they do not but I think her character changes significantly when she meets Jolene and the basement she used to play in with Mr. Shaibel. Just because her change isn\u2019t instantaneous does not mean it did not occur. I think this contributed to the \u201cslow burn\u201d of the show that others have mentioned.

What is more, and has already been said here, her character's psychological evolution is so linear and underdeveloped that a great opportunity for understanding the roots of addiction or the colors of neurodivergence are missed completely....\n\nit just creates the overall impression that chess is easy if you are a genius but that being genius will also make you a selfish  unpleasant addict",

But no, Helen turns out to be genuinely nice and Beth adapts to the whole situation. You dont get a sense of her loss, her vulnerability, any emotional weight that might be is driving her addiction, or her motivation in chess. Its ostenibly a girl power type story, but its hard to root for her, because everything that makes Beth 'strong' just seems like a feeble egotrip, she was just born better. She's a genius - not explored. She's orphanned - not explored. She develops an addiction - not explored. None of the relationships really matter. The world is harsh but never mind.",

This wasn't that. I thought the show did good work dramatizing the chess and keeping it interesting. I would have wished they showed the board a bit more, so that you could actually see the moves properly and follow the game at least momentarily. I feel like ranting about the chess style being from a wrong timeline or people communicating over the board is just... well, it's not a documentary but a dramatization - it made the games more interesting. If you feel that the liberties it took in chess were too much, then thats fine but I strongly disagree. I'm the type of person who watches Top Gun: Maverick and doesn't give a shit that the mission they do wouldn't actually be done in that way but with some missile strike or whatever.\n\nToken black character - I'm honestly SO tired of this bullshit. If there are 0 black people in a show, it's racist. If there's one, it's a token. If there's more, that's unrealistic for the time and it will feel forced. The adoptive mom even said: only people your age who work are coloured. It was a (more) racist time, like get over it. I thought the character of Jolene was really good and the way she reappeared long after the childhood scenes was really nice.\n\nIn fact that's one of the biggest parts I liked about the show: the beginning in the facility where she was, was dark and powerful and it was kind of quickly forgotten and you got used to her being an older and attractive, independent woman. Then later on you get these reminders of the childhood times and it felt really nostalgic even to the viewer and you felt like Harmon, you had forgotten about it and now it feels so important (Jolene, and the guy who taught Harmon chess in the basement).\n\nI thought the relationships were nicely portrayed. She didn't have the love of her life, there were these different guys who she sometimes very minorly sparked with and it was ambiguous if they were into her and how seriously. That's realistic. I felt like it was very natural and something that represented real life unusually well.\n\nLast thing, draws did come up earlier than last episode. Up to the later parts of the series she was winning everyone anyways, but she did mentioned drawing against some players when talking to her adoptive mom. But you're right that they didn't happen maybe as often as they do in real life but big deal",

On the one hand, you have the positive and caring male figures in her life, such as the janitor at the orphanage; on the other, you have both her biological father and her adoptive father deserting her; and in the middle you have a few guys she's either attracted to or using, one of whom is apparently gay, one of whom is a well-meaning dork who moves out because he can't seem to handle a very low-level disagreement (but who later returns out of concern over Beth's addiction); and another who wears a leather jacket everywhere and who is the only guy she actually enjoys having sex with, but whom she says she doesn't love and who pisses her off by wanting to talk about chess in bed (you'd think she wouldn't mind that).  Oh, and there are a pair of identical twins that for some inexplicable reason make her adoptive cougar mother hot.  \n\nAnd they all make a reprise at the end in Benny's apartment, along with a few other dudes that we met in passing.  \n\n\nSo ... how is the relationship to men theme resolved in the series?  In a kind of Hallmark Channel way where everything somehow works out and everybody becomes good friends, that's how.  \n\n\nI, too, Googled, searching for criticism of this series and wondering if I was the only one who didn't like it, and I found a *New Yorker* article that was critical - but the only real criticism in that *New Yorker* piece as that the actress playing Beth was too good looking and could not play the desperation that the novel's Beth feels.  But I think that critique barely scratches the surface.",

The show and everything in it is three years old. \n\nSomehow you missed:\n\n> Jolene is a token character who did her job. \n\nWhich, maybe, was easy to miss. You, however, have one post (and quite a few comments) on Reddit. Your post isn\u2019t a year old, yet and states you\u2019ve started a business because: racism. \n\nGreat. Right there I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to take the side of someone who doesn\u2019t agree with tokenism in literature or entertainment and feels the need to interject in past discussions rather than to introduce or engage in new discussions. \n\nGood on ya, mate. \n\nHowever, your point adds nothing, changes nothing, and establishes yourself as difficult. None of such is out of line, per se, as this is an anonymous forum full of people from different backgrounds discussing often inane things. \n\nWhat you clearly don\u2019t seem to grasp, outside of age of content, is that your opinion, while valid for you, is irrelevant and amounts to noise. Jolene was and will always remain (via Netflix) a token character. Incidentally, a token character that didn\u2019t need to exist at all. \n\nOf cast the cast is dominantly white. In case you missed this, somehow, between history and watching TV and movies, and in so many other ways, in the United States white is still the dominant skin color and in the 1960s, even during the height of the civil rights movement, it was even more so. \n\nWhether or not this is intended to be revisionist or alternate history, the nature of entertainment is to reflect the demographics of the intended audience. To be fair, though, not enough is being done to balance this. Even now. Definitely not then. Therefore, a story about white folk in a part of the country that is dominantly white in neighborhoods that are white and institutions (the orphanage) that would\u2019ve been all white, you\u2019re demanding more anachronistic judgement and anachronistic insertions of equality and duality.\n\nThat\u2019s fine. I get that. But to insert your *opinion* as though it is either new or unspoken or unaddressed and as though it has any real impact on anything, other than to get a commenter to engage three years later, is about the extent to which you\u2019re going to engage anyone. \n\nStand up against racism, I\u2019m right there with you. Call out Hollywood for not doing more, I\u2019ll sign the petition. But trying to insert anything into this as new or important and more than your ego at play and you lost me. Because any demand that requires everyone to be represented in all places and at all times, especially in entertainment, is irrational, impossible, and you\u2019ll never be able to support the argument in any meaningful, non-emotional way.",

A lot of TVs only have a certain port that supports HDCP 2.2 (required for 4K).\n\nYour TV app disregards HDCP because it's built in and you should be able to get Dolby Vision/4k (You'd get BOTH, but you'd only see \"Dolby Vision\" badging on the title) on a title like Our Planet, assuming your bandwidth can handle it.",

        "text": "Queens Gambit is my absolute favorite show this year, and felt that it was so incredibly filled with important lessons that I had to make a post (and a video) discussing these very lessons. I'm a mental and performance coach, training people to be the most confident, resilient, and effective versions of themselves in overcoming their obstacles and accomplishing their most challenging goals. I'm going to discuss concepts I saw in the show, and my reaction to the series.\n\n*I want this post to add value independent of my video link. If linking in this context is still not allowed, please let me know and I'll take it out.*\n\nLet's go over some lessons from Beth's journey (and character traits, too). The video is more comprehensive.\n\n**Video: \"The Genius of Queen's Gambit\"**: [https://youtu.be/a3WG6dqkoJ0](https://youtu.be/a3WG6dqkoJ0)\n\n**1. Beth's curiosity and commitment are strong qualities that get her ahead in life**. When she gets intrigued by chess, she immediately latches onto it. More importantly, she continues to pursue it long after the honeymoon period is over. This is a lesson/reminder that as we get more and more of our human impulses satisfied faster than ever, love and passion for a craft manifests into a skill over **time**. So, we have to remember to kindle the curiosity, be patient, and commit for as long as possible. The longer you can stay curious about your craft, the deeper you'll go.\n\n**2. Beth is incredibly creative in how she practices her craft.** Her use of visualization and imagination to play chess is an incredible feat of obsession and determination. Constantly thinking and pondering about playing chess is a huge strength- and something you can definitely do without drugs (I get it, she does rely on it for most of the show). So learn to be creative in how you approach your interests; don't just give up if there's a little resistance (like no chess board in front of you). Make sure your obsession is worth it (won't bankrupt you, is not detrimental to your health or well being). Clear out time in your day to just think and theorize about ways you can learn and improve.\n\n**3. Beth self reviews her chess games, which is key to competitive growth**. This allows her to identify her blind spots, recognize mistakes, and learn quicker- not only from her own games, but from others' games. It also helps her be process-oriented, as the result of a past game is long gone. In your own life, review your own processes and do self-reflection. Get feedback from your own point of view, and also other people. This includes those who think differently than you, and have different backgrounds. Ensure that your actions on a day-to-day level map to your goals. This will put you on the right path to succeed, regardless of what your goal is.\n\n**4. Hard work unlocks talent**. Otherwise, talent is just a bare head start. Beth constantly reads and studies different chess games from books, magazines, and any other outlet she can find. While she has an admittedly incredible gift, she also works hard to make something out of it. There are plenty of talented people who never get anywhere because of a lack of hard work- and hard work is something you can control. We all know this- so what should we remember? Don't coast on your talents (or more applicable, your recent or past success). Focus only on consistently improving (regardless if slow and gradual), and learn to love the work. The work is the only thing you truly control.\n\n**5. Learn to cherish your relationships**. Beth doesn't have a lot of consistent people in her life; she's constantly traveling and her friends are from all different places. If you haven't reached out to your friends or family recently, do so. Especially in 2020, going into 2021. You don't have to be close to every single one; just check in on them. The people that you do have are very valuable (which Beth learns as an orphan).\n\n**My thoughts on actors, production**:\n\n* EVERY single actor played their role incredibly well. Their use of facial expressions to make chess games exciting should be a master class in acting.\n* All of the hair styles, design, sets, colors, etc. were so perfectly done that I felt fully immersed in the 1950s-1960s.\n* The music is absolutely spectacular. I've been listening to it when I work, as well as during the 1 week it took me to edit this video (I have a job and coach).\n\nFor my full detailed breakdown all of Beth Harmon's strengths, weaknesses, and journey- check out my video. Would love any feedback as well, it's the most editing-intensive video I've done in a long time.",

This show was really really interesting in it's approach to a subject that could have been done so poorly.\n\nA few other things I'll add that I appreciated:\n\n* Positive depiction of men losing to a woman. It would have been extremely easy to slip into a \"men being sore losers after being beaten by a woman\" stereotype given the time period in a predominately male dominated sport. They threw a few of these into the mix but I really like how the last episode focused on how well these masters lost to her and genuinely respected her win.\n* Pretty balanced approach to her sexuality. I appreciated that they didn't shy away from this as it feels very easy to paint \"prodigies\" as relentlessly focused on their particular talent and not driven by anything else. The show blends her relationships and sexuality very well while never really making a overt statement about it.\n\nOne thing I thought could have been done a bit better:\n\n* Addiction is a big focus in the early episodes and then kind of just goes away in later episodes. It feels like we are just supposed to feel like she \"willed\" her addiction away but it feels like a tough pill to swallow (pun intended).\n\nOverall this was a really great series and I hope the folks that worked on it get to do more work in the near future.",

I grew up thinking, \"oh, I have a question about this, so it must not be for me.\" It wasn't until I became an adult and found that if I want to move forward with anything, I need to constantly ask questions and pursue knowledge or I will fall flat. \n\nBeth's first tournament was one of my favorite sequences because she asked about everything: ranking, seating, time clocks, grandmasters, and Las Vegas. She left that day with so much new knowledge and zero judgement. It was the most realistic example of learning I have ever seen in a TV program or movie.",

I believe shows that display grace in losing are good bc viewers can model that behavior.\n\nDidn't even think about your second point. That's an excellent thought. Shows interest me because sometimes the end product doesn't always reflect initial intent, and get run through many filters including execs\n\nI agree with your last point as well. It's a good thing I didn't expect them to develop an accurate depiction of addiction recovery.\n\nHave a nice evening",

I completely agree, I think a lot of movies skip over the progression and don't really make the character REACHING a point of success cathartic enough.\n\nI love that you mentioned how inquisitiveness and that is a huge reason she gets so far. even back when she talks to mr shaibel it's all questions until she can get more understanding of the game. and frankly, i'd guess it's also a great predictor of success in academics & all sorts of different fields. Maybe I'll make a video in the future on the topic of inquisitiveness.\n\nThanks so much for the thoughts and if you have any suggestions for topics or feedback on how I can improve, let me know :) have a great day",

One of my favorite shows. \n\n\nKipo and The Age of the Wonderbeasts . It\u2019s three seasons. It\u2019s got a dope soundtrack, good writing, and great animation.",

It won't blow your mind, but it's an interesting look into a different aspect of Brazil, my country), \"Good Morning, Veronica\" (It's also a Brazilian TV show, really good detective story based on a novel that focus a lot in domestic violence). The Mechanism is also a good bet if you want to see a dramatized version of Brazil's corruption scheme and scandals that rocked our world in recent years, it adapts the core aspects faithfully, but there are some liberties taken for the purpose of the story.\n\nAlso, Midnight Gospel, a podcast/animation that have people talking about different philosophies and their lives amid chaotic animation that is an allegory to what they're talking about. It's worth checking out at the least episode, it will give you the feels.",

What do all those shows you mentioned have in common? They\u2019re all really dark and gritty. In a TV landscape that effectively has two genres (grit and comedy), The Queens Gambit takes everything we\u2019ve learned about good TV over the last decade, removes the dark aesthetic, and leaves you with a really well done character study that doesn\u2019t have life threatening existential risks, or otherwise leave you feeling extreme dread. All that has to be said about the landscape of TV right now is look at what Netflix did with Sabrina the Teenage Witch. They took a sitcom with some spooky Halloween-esque themes and turned it into real horror (not making any assumptions of that show, just point out what style of storytelling is trendy at the moment). \n\nStranger Things also comes to mind at accomplishing this, but it does the reverse of The Queen\u2019s Gambit. It\u2019s a show with dark sci-fi material and wraps it in a lighter tone. *However*, it still has that element of existential threat that The Queens Gambit doesn\u2019t - and that\u2019s what makes it feel so fresh. It\u2019s just a really well done character study that explores adult themes while not straying into gritty darkness. The article I read made a good point, the author said something to the effect of \u201cit subverts your expectations by not subverting your expectations\u201d. We\u2019ve been so trained to look for where things completely fall apart, and the show plays on that. \n\nAlso, Anya Taylor-Joy is a phenomenal actress and just really brings the character to life.",

Ok, just a little bit ashamed.\n\nYou have to watch Grand Tour, but you also have to find a way to watch the first 23 or so seasons of Top Gear, trust me, so incredibly worth it, even if you're not really a car person, it's not really a car show, it's something amazing. I think at least a few of the bbc seasons are on Prime, definitely try it out.\n\nThere's only one season but Sneaky Pete is funny\n\nYou can watch 30 Rock on prime, something I always recommend.",

I'm actually starting to appreciate the format, you get all the time in the world to tell a complete story and you don't have to sit around waiting for another season. \n\nIf you wanna break into the Chinese shows without wading through sappy love stories, Handsome Siblings has become one of my favorite shows of all time, because the main character guy, Xiaoyu, is so fantastic to watch. It's an awesome introduction to period style wuxia, and it's only 44 episodes, super highly recommend.",

Major spoilers below.\n\n>!Ok so we\u2019ve got this person who has a severe and pretty much lifelong drug and alcohol addiction. You can see her spiraling and unable to break out of the cycle. And the show is in a big way about addiction; it was a main plot point, not a throwaway thing. Then in the end they just throw it away. She one days says \u201chm, I don\u2019t want to be an addict anymore\u201d and... is fine? Except she probably isn\u2019t, she\u2019ll probably relapse because she\u2019s done nothing to really deal with her addiction. So the ending wasn\u2019t really satisfying to me, because I didn\u2019t see anything that made me think she wasn\u2019t headed straight back to another relapse or had necessarily grown in a major way besides being really good at chess. Because of that, while it was very entertaining and that\u2019s reason enough to watch it, it isn\u2019t the sort of show I think I\u2019ll remember five years from now.  !<\n\n\nI would still recommend the show to anybody who likes a good drama.",

It made her feel warm and loved, feelings she got addicted to!<\n>!She did associate her success with it in the start due to the fact that she was able to visualize the board and play through. When she was playing Borgov again in Moscow, she was able to visualize the board on the ceiling without the pills!<\n>!Drugs and especially alcohol was a strong connection to her adoptive mother. After her death, Beth\u2019s way of coping was to consume more in order to forget/blend out what she felt towards her!<\n>!The pills were also a replacement for loved ones. When she knew that her friends (Benny, Matt, etc.) had her back in New York, she felt like she didn\u2019t need the pills anymore!<\n\nDo you agree/disagree? Let me know!",

It begins with a pawn sacrifice, the Queen's Gambit, which can be a stodgy, orthodox opening that often ends in a draw. Both players, however, gradually build up the tension in their positions because they love the game and know its beauty. Every move they make contributes to the inspiration of the opponent's next move. They challenge, confuse and startle each other as the fighting game grows more and more intense. I had been worried that consultants Kasparov and Pandolfini, with the help of computers, would create a grotesque beast of a game in 53 moves, a chess player's sensational but unrealistic fantasy. To my delight, the consultants did their job and the game is lovely, combining history and fiction with a balance of subtlety and brilliance. After Borgov makes his last strong move, which looks like the arrival of a grim reaper, Harmon studies the ceiling, and makes a quietly devastating move of her own that proceeds to hobble Borgov. The beauty of the position grows and grows, with Harmon's final move, slowly and permanently sliding her King out of harms way, surprising herself that there was nothing left for Borgov to do except resign. Right then and there.",

        "text": "I just finished the series in less than 2 days and I loved every minute of it and I think you'd love it too.\n\nHonestly it's one of the best netflix originals ever and clearly the best of the year. There are several reasons for that. Its subject can be pretty surprising and off-putting to some (not me though, always loved chess so I was intrigued from the start!) but it's handled with such talent and efficiency that even if you don't even know the rules, you won't get bored. The chess matches are so well done and are genuinely exciting but that's also because there is so much more to it. It's a story about resilience and trusting yourself and become the master of your own fate, which, granted, sounds a bit cheesy but honestly.. it's just very inspiring. They also touch on so many other subjects with class, subtlety and restraint and it's just delightful and drives the point home.\n\nEverything about her story is interesting and captivating and the excellent Anya Taylor-Joy (who I have loved ever since The VVitch) just makes the story shine. Her performance is stellar, with a heavy focus on attitude, facial expressions and body language which makes her acting so incredibly good and honestly ? Worthy of all the awards she could get. She's insanely talented the story really lets her flex her acting muscles and gives a nuanced and electric performance. \n\nThe solitude she faced is perfectly conveyed through the directing, the music and her acting that it can almost be overwhelming. It can be pretty sad but they never overdo it.  It's genuinely beautiful and enthralling to see her progress through her career and form new connections and to see her relationships evolve. Nothing ever feels gratuitous, **the writing is superb. It's incredibly subtle and understated but it's so perfectly written that it just amplifies every emotion they want to convey.** The dialogues and the acting are **great** too. So is the directing, the photography, and the sets and costumes which are absolutely gorgeous. And the music.... the music is incredible, poignant at times, exciting and thrilling when it needs to be. **It is superb work they've done here**.\n\nHonestly I could just go on and on about it, it's just a really great show. It's real and genuine and the ending might be the best ending to a miniseries I've ever seen ? It's beautiful and satisfying and **it just made me feel so good**, which I think we all need right now.",

It didnt ruin the show in any way but i was little bummed",

I wish they would have done some research and checked how music was used for shows/movies like this in the 60s. This is yet  again an example where Netflix allows the minimum for shows to be different and extraordinary but then keeps it in line with its standard production means. Nevertheless, I did like the show and really want to watch further.",

Her costume, the walk among the players and received from them their adulation of their queen.\n\nNow I have to watch the final episode again.\n\nGod what a great show it was, but especially that final episode.  It 100% provided closure.\n\nYet, I think there is easily room to undertake a 2nd series.  I think it would be very interesting if she could mentor the young Russian she played, but there is much more that can be explored.",

And since Harmon is based on Bobby Fischer, the series also paid homage to him. For example, one of Bobby Fischer's favorite moves is Queen's gambit. And after game 6 of 1972 world championship, Spassky (the Soviet world champion then) stood up and applauded Fischer just like what they showed in the end of epi 7. There are a lot of these moments chess nerds would appreciate.",

They were kind of feeding off each other, you know? When 2 people watch a movie together for the first time and they decide they don't like it, they will sit there and make fun of it, pointing things out to eachother, that's kind of how I would explain last night.\n\nI can see where they are coming from.  Both my sister and I have played in professional orchestras for most our lives (before she died last year, RIP), and somebody recommended we watch \"Mozart in the Jungle\" and yeah, we did the same thing.  We only got through a few episodes.  It's almost frustrating.  Seeing your life's work compacted into a few episodes of a fictional TV show is weird.  They made it look fun, and silly, with funny outgoing characters that go out and party after performances and play jokes on each other during rehearsals.  In real life, it is the exact opposite of that.",

But everything - the acting, the cinematography, the directing, the music and the sets/costumes were all a home run.\n\nI know it was a limited run show but I think they could easily justify a 2nd series.  She mentoring the young Russian she faced in one of the episodes would be very interesting.  But there are so many viable storylines. \n\nI wonder if she understood any of the chess moves and theory or was it all pure acting and direction?",

I know many will not pay attention to that kind of stuff or remember the scene but it illustrates how strong the camerawork and immersion of the show is. In so many of the scenes you really feel like you're in the 1960s. It's a totally deep and multifaceted watching experience and you can tell the director wanted us to experience each scene as much as he wanted to deliver the story and dialogue.",

These questions of whether your gift is a blessing or a curse, of whether ones path has been set at birth, are not limited to a race or sex or an era.\nThat's what's so great about this show, it doesn't have an overt agenda, and  the best parts are so subtle.  Sentences are said with a stare, and entire conversations are reduced to just a sentence or two (see Townes in the final episode).  One of the few shows that I instantly want to rewatch.",

Hear me out. \n\nShe is an anomaly, a girl that our girls should not aspire to be. She takes drugs while young to help her hallucinate and visualise chess pieces and the board at night, a drug induced coma that no kid should go through.\n\nShe is naturally gifted and dominates in a sport that is only played by men, which is just unrealistic in any sense of our real world and creates a sense of false hope for our kids. \n\nI do like her tenacity and how she has a strong drive to study the game of chess and reads books and is passionate about the game. She\u2019s not afraid to pursue her passion to explore every aspect, but the show makes this look like an easy pursuit, when in real life it\u2019s a life long process and requires immense dedication, with no time to drink and party and take drugs with random people. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate they created an almost perfect character but Beth was just too unrealistic and winning games and beating tough opponents comes too easy for her to make her character  truly believable. \n\nHowever the show does well with porting the viewer back in time with the vintage settings outfitted style and music, the shows soundtrack is incredible and they\u2019ve picked out songs very well.",

These were big name DJs who talked to all kinds of famous people as part of their jobs. And they were big enough names in their industry that they understood, to a certain extent, what it was like to be \"famous.\" (One of them is now the Chief Executive of music programming at CMT and deals with the biggest names in country music on a daily basis.)  All 3 of them, to this day decades later, say that Heath was undeniably their worst interview guest. That is shocking to me but it carries weight coming from them.

He's clearly extremely socially anxious, I can see it a mile off because I've dealt with the same problems my entire life. Watch almost any interview of him, he's super fidetey, and you can tell he's just in his mind. He doesn't pick up on normal social ques, and it creates this sort of tension between him and the interviewer. I've read he found interviews and all the media red carpet stuff really intense and nerve wrecking. My theory is that maybe it's his anxiety that lead him to drugs in the first place, as a coping mechanism. I can relate to that also, though(thanks God) I never went for opiates I ended up using other drugs for many years, purely just to cope. Just to feel normal and to be able to interact normally. \nIn the end the drugs make it worse, because then you have to deal with drug problems on top of your anxiety problems.\n\nIt really just goes to show how good of an actor he was that he could play incredible charismatic and charming people, but the reality was he wasn't any of those things. But his anxiety is probably another reason why he was able to dive so deeply into a role, to immerse himself in his work as an escape from how he feels in his normal life. I've also used my creative outlet as a coping mechanism which has resulted me me being really good at what I do compared to other who don't feel the need to escape into their craft. \n\nWorst guest in what way I wander? I'm picturing a similar circumstance to how his interviews on YouTube go, just super awkward basically, bit you can tell he's a caring person under the awkwardness.",

        "text": "I just finished watching the Queen's Gambit and absolutely loved it. But there is a detail that never quite sat right with me and I wonder if anyone else has written about or explored this idea.\n\nThe car accident that Beth survives doesn't make any sense. She was in the back seat of the car. in the 1950s. She is wearing no discernable seat belt... Maybe she had a two-point seat belt, as if that would do anything to protect her. She was in a head-on collision with another vehicle travelling in the opposite direction that immediately killed the mother. In the only image of the accident that the series shows, Beth is seen in the foreground in front of the wrecked vehicles WITHOUT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON HER. From that moment on it is taken for granted that this accident is the true cause of her mother's death and the reason for her being orphaned.\n\nThis show isn't about superheroes with magical powers. It is about a chess prodigy leaving in a plausible alternative universe where instead of Bobby Fischer taking on the Soviets in chess it is a young redheaded orphan girl. The psychological tone of the story is so well realized that I can't help but think that the unbelievability of Beth surviving the car accident ISN'T lazy writing. I think that the story of her mother's death is one that Beth made up to quell her own feelings of abandonment. It is another layer to the story that speaks to the reality (or lack thereof) of the events depicted in the series. After all, the POV for the series is Beth Harmon's. I don't think this means that every event in the show as a whole is necessarily unreliable as it is in The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I do think that it is meaningful that the accident itself is never depicted on the show. We the audience never see the two cars collide with one another. And in storytelling, if you don't see something, then you can't know exactly what happened.\n\nMaybe her mother did die in the accident. Maybe Beth tells herself, and even believes, that she was in the car. But there is NO WAY that Beth actually survived the car accident as it is described on the show.\n\nThoughts?",

Forgot about it. Until watching this series. Just ordered a chess set.\n\nThe thing I remember most about chess was that anticipation, like not knowing what way they will go, planning the possibilities, and the planning your responses. And other small things...like making it look like you\u2019re moving a specific way/line of attack, but secretly working on something else behind the scenes. The game is so much more fun than people give it credit for.",

I remember chuckling at beth\u2019s little act of rebellion against him (trying to be as spoiler free as possible here) and how several episodes down the line it pays off unexpectedly in a way that both illuminated and enhanced a character who basically was in all of three scenes in a seven episode production. That sort of attention to detail I think is what sets this series apart from most any other limited series I\u2019ve seen of late. It\u2019s one of the best tv productions of the decade, imo (and it\u2019s been a very good decade for tv productions!)\n\nAlso, the last episode could have flat out been a stand alone movie.

Back in 2003, it was becoming serious and Kylie Minogue was even in talks to play one of the female leads.",

It's supposed to help imbue character and also subvert our expectations.  \n\nI actually found it kind of refreshing that she didn't stay a mousy, virginal girl with a traumatic past who just happened to be really, really good at chess.  That would've been boring.  Why couldn't she like chess, AND like to dress fashionably?  Does it have to be one or the other?  If so, that's rather limiting, and also wouldn't make the character have as much of an impact, considering its time period.  For me, as a woman who personally has many \"quirky\" interests but also likes to dress up, I found it to be realistic, and more so, empowering.  \n\nAlso refreshing was the fact that while it's been marketed as an \"addiction\" story, the truth is...it is, and it isn't.  She's someone who never dealt with her past because of life's constant hard knocks, and as such, developed some unhealthy coping mechanisms along the way.  She is isn't violent or abusive, just self-destructive the way we all might be at various points.  A lot of her issues were internal.  It gave us the right amount of time it needed to tell us that, yes, Beth is partial to drink and drugs\u2014and at the story's peak moment, when she is at her lowest, she will break and use both weaknesses to cope.  In this sense, I don't think it was heavy-handed at all.",

Then, the quarantine and the shortages made yeast hard to buy.  Then, our sourdough group on the book of faces, which had been around 35,000 worldwide members, started expanding, when everyone got the idea to make fermented bread (no commercial yeast).  Then, flour got added to the list of ingredients that were hard to buy.   \n\nAnd now, we have over 85,000 members, all trying to answer basic questions...how do I make a starter?  What\u2019s wrong with my starter?  How do I keep a starter? \n\nAt the same time, there was the release on Netflix of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, which talks about the universality of bread.  Combine that with the release of the news that the guy who started a tech company also had a project involving reviving yeast from vessels excavated in Egyptian tombs.  \n\nI started baking sourdough when I realized that commercial bread upset my stomach.  Luckily, I started about a year before COVID, so I was able to help, at a time when bread mentors were not yet overwhelmed, and learned via Messenger.  Since then, I have mentored bakers from California, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, and talked technique with bakers from all over the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating topic, and the bread is incredibly delicious.  However, it is both an art and a science, and takes quite some time to have success, as opposed to using commercial yeast, which is predictable.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like to try, I\u2019d like to help!",

(A recent NY Times article even suggested that it might've even been written as a send-up on Bobby Fisher's own opinions about women playing chess.)\n\nOf course, true geniuses like that are a rarity in real life...but if stories' premises stuck so closely to reality, what would be the point?  Art can provide a realistic mirror to our everyday lives, and that's fine; but art also serves as a function to examine and parse our place in the world.  Even if the premise is a little out there, the characters still have to react in a way that makes sense within that world. And as long as the latter holds true, I think you can suspend disbelief in the former.\n\nEdit: Parenthetical aside.",

I was more focused on the story being told than the chess matches.   \n\n\nMy son loves chess and decided a few months ago to start learning Russian, so I told him that while the scenes where Russian is spoken are brief, he could still learn something new by watching. He's still at an age where sexual content in media is something he wants to avoid, but I thought the scenes that included that content were relatively tame. This series felt like it was made in the era it was set in. I really appreciated that about it.   \n\n\nI've been recommending this to everyone I know.",

It was good that Harry Beltik showed up again, thought after the 6th episode that he would not come back. The best scene at the end was definitely the phone call where she was presented all the possible moves and their solutions - it had something of Harry Potter meeting the people of 'Dumbledore's Army' for the first time.\n< \n\nAltogether it was simply good and her look was amazing.",

He would have been analysing them very hard.\n\nIt was common practice with adjournments to seal an unusual move, just so that the opponent would waste time analysing variations that would not occur on the board.    Adjournments died out when computers became strong, as it was seen as unfair. Now games are played to a finish in one session with a speeded up time limit.\n\nI used to hate adjournments with a passion.  In the London league they used to seal after only 30 moves, which meant many games, and would have to travel all the way in to bishopsgate just to finish the game, it also meant having to spend hours studying the position, which as a student was a bit of a time hog.",

I loved the casual growing up of Harmon by what she wore and her hair and a little bit of increased sexualizatiom, without having to do any nudity.  I loved the set elements and wondered what their budget was for some of those hotel lobbies.  I loved the mom and her acting and couldn't help smile thinking the actress must have loved playing that part.  I loved Harmon's quiet strength without being a dick about it. \n\nAlso anyone else catch her name is Harmon E., harmony?",
