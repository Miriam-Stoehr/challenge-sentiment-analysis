        "text": "The Queen's Gambit feels like nothing really happens in it. There are interesting events, but it\u2019s as if the series doesn\u2019t really do anything with them. The relationship between Harmon and the janitor wasn\u2019t fully developed either. Later on, Harmon seems to regard the orphanage as if she experienced some major trauma there, yet aside from the trouble she caused herself by overdosing on pills, the headmistress didn\u2019t harm her in any way.\n\nThe twin chess players who were with her in Mexico City, and jumped into the pool with her after her adoptive mother died, simply disappeared and were never seen again. Nothing significant was done with them in the storyline. It\u2019s almost like the supporting characters are more interesting than the main one. For instance, why does Benny Watts carry a knife? Why does he live in such a run-down apartment? Harmon and Harry Beltik's relationship could have been explored further, showing how he was worried about her.\n\nNothing bad really happens to Harmon throughout the entire series. Anything bad that did happen to her was a result of her own actions, and even then, it didn\u2019t have any real consequences. At the orphanage, she overdoses. The headmistress tells her she won\u2019t be able to play chess anymore, but we don\u2019t see any actual repercussions from that. The overdose was entirely her fault. Her adoptive father tries to cheat her out of the house, but she just buys it anyway. There are no withdrawal symptoms from her substance abuse either. Everything just falls into her lap, and the main character is constantly ungrateful.\n\nI bet Benny or the janitor would be a more interesting character. The janitor literally jump-started her career. He taught her how to play chess and gave her the first five dollars to start with, which she didn\u2019t even pay back. The main character is boring, has no real challenges or problems in her life, overreacts to everything, and is ungrateful on top of it. Adding to that, instead of showing the main character overreacting to everything, and focusing for long minutes on her drinking and pill-popping, they could have spent less time on this and focused more on the other characters and their development. As it stands, it feels like nothing really happened in the series. I think the show is overrated.\n\nEnglish is not my native language. Sorry if I express myself weirdly. ",

You keep coming back to the comment of nothing bad happens to her and she did things to herself. Which just\u2026isn\u2019t true.\n\nAt 8 year old, she loses her mother in a car crash. Then her dad doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s traumatic? Idk what\u2019s happened in your life but like\u2026as someone who lost a parent at a young age, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how privileged you sound when you say nothing bad really happens to her throughout the series. \n\nJust think about that for a second.\n\nThen think about getting sent to an orphanage at 8 years old. That sucks. And they put you on tranquilizers that become an addiction because you\u2019re still grieving the death of your mom and abandonment by your dad.\n\nAnd then as an adult, her adoptive mom dies. And her adoptive dad tries to screw her out of a house. And she\u2019s competing in a sport that\u2019s incredibly sexist, in an era that\u2019s incredibly sexist. And doesnt really know how to act in this world because she, once again, grew up in an orphanage without loving parents figures to guide her. Which is part of the reason she falls prey to drugs and alcohol.\n\nThings happen in the show. It just seems like, for whatever reason, you weren\u2019t interested in what happened to her so you discounted the very real issues she faced.\n\nBenny lives in such a rundown apartment because it was New York City and he was a bohemian and chess doesn\u2019t pay that well. There\u2019s not much to explore there. He carried a knife because he lived in NYC in the decades when it was dangerous. And he thought it made him look cool. There\u2019s not much to explore there either.\n\n\u201cNothing happened\u201d because the show is driven by character psychology and you\u2019re supposed to reflect on her psychology and behavior as it relates to her life experiences. But it seems you struggled to connect with her and put yourself in her shoes. But found yourself connecting with the male characters and being interested in them.",

        "text": "I know this isn't necessarily an *unpopular* opinion, but it is contested on here with a lot of people complaining about shorter TV series. I see as many people dispute this notion as I do see support it. We may be in an era of splintered content (although apart from a brief Netflix period, we always were) but we're also completely spoiled by content.\n\nA lot of old schools types will affirm the late 90s perhaps up until the early 10s as the \"golden age\" for television. So basically the noughties. They'll usually list The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men and Six Feet Under as the best shows of all time. Maybe Lost. To be sure, these are shows that remain culturally prominent - but once you move past them, the era begins to show how thin it was in terms of content diversity.\n\n* (1) The 90s and noughties could mostly be defined as being primarily comprised of legal, medical and cop procedurals. Or very long 16-22 long episode shows with self-contained episodes being the norm. HBO tended to break this formula, of course. This was obviously great for people who liked that formula, but people into speculative fiction (sci-fi, fantasy, horror) had very little to discover. You had some space operas like Farscape and BSG that remain solid, but beyond that the field was pretty bad. Whilst one might argue, subjectively, that the peaks of the 00s and early 10s were \"better\" than the peaks of the late 10s and early 20s, keep in mind that most TV of the 90s, 00s were 22 episode long police/legal/medical procedurals that leaned heavily on the \"case of the week\" formula. A tired old format. If you go back to the 70's and 80's it was private detective shows, or buddy-cop stuff. And in the 50's and 60's... westerns.\n\n* Maybe one could argue there were more A* TV shows in the late 00s and early 10s (although this is and always will be pretty subjective), but there are plenty more B+ TV shows now. The quality gap between Sopranos, The Wire and Breaking Bad (which are of limited appeal if you don't like crime shows, like me) and mostly everything else was pretty big.\n\n*  (2) There was very little international content, or access to it. Foreign TV shows obviously did exist in the 00s but they weren't easily accessible, advertised or had much of a budget relative to the US. Mostly everything of high concept quality was American or British. Since the streaming era has took off, geography has become no boundary and people access content from around the world - and streamers now put money into buying and commissioning TV shows from across the world in a way that they've never done before. Most notably Korea, but increasingly many European TV shows.\n\n* (3) As touched upon in (1) - there's much more genre diversity. There's way more sci-fi, fantasy, horror and general speculative fiction being made now than in the 00s. Whereas if you didn't like crime content in the 00s, you were locked out of a lot of oft-stated prestige content (that's still somewhat true now, but not remotely as it was). I myself am personally not really into crime dramas, so The Wire, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos as concepts hold little interest to me.\n\n* (4) Modern entertainment is generally 'grittier' than in the 90s and 00s. This is the age of anti-heroes, and anti-villains. Whilst some people might consider a lot of modern TV content 'edgy' and disparage it for that, others enjoy the fact that we get darker and greyer stories. There are still of course many saccharine exceptions to this (Ted Lasso, Heartstopper) etc that buck the trend.\n\nIf you really like the older monster/case/criminal-of-the-week writing style, then you do you. It still exists on network TV, although it'll not often get mentioned on places like this and is confined almost entirely to cop or medical shows now. If you really like older sitcoms, then I guess you might be right there - sitcoms do seem to have fallen out of production - but in so many other ways is modern TV much stronger than many older years.

You may have specific preferences - everyone does, but their reputation here is mostly strong. Yes, some fell-off to some degree according to many (Westworld, Mandalorian, Altered Carbon, Man in the High Castle) - but they're still highly rated at least for half of their run - and plenty of older shows had quality declines.\n\n----\n\nI will admit that I don't really like the 1.5 to 3 year gap between seasons that seem to becoming more and more common in many productions.",

                "comment_text": "Most of us who complain about those things aren't pessimists. We're happy with a lot of things about TV today. But we also see certain aspects of it getting worse, and do mention those, because we'd like that stuff to get better again. \n\nAlso:\n\n> keep in mind that most TV of the 90s, 00s were 22 episode long police/legal/medical procedurals that leaned heavily on the \"case of the week\" formula. A tired old format.\n\n\"Case of the week\" is not a tired old format, and 22 episode seasons are great. \n\nYou literally included Poker Face and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds in your list of shows that are good. Poker Face is as case-of-the-week as it gets. It's a deliberate homage to Columbo. And Strange New Worlds is a return to the Star Trek of the 1960s through early 2000s, as opposed to Picard and Discovery that are heavily serialized and bear little resemblance to Trek shows of the past. You will find many, many people here who love Psych, Buffy, Veronica Mars, or The X-Files, so I don't think there's a thing tired about it. \"Case of the week\" is only tired if the show is tired. \n\n22 episode seasons *did* used to have a lot of cop/lawyer/doctor procedurals. Now, they are almost nothing but. \n\n20 years ago, on the fall 2004 schedule, network TV had Lost, Gilmore Girls, 7th Heaven, Everwood, Star Trek: Enterprise, Desperate Housewives, The OC, Tru Calling, One Tree Hill, and Everwood on the schedule, among others, that were clearly outside the cop/lawyer/doctor genres. Today? Just about every scripted hour long show on the network schedule for fall 2024 is an FBI/NCIS/Law & Order/Chicago/911. If you expand cop/lawyer/doctor to include firefighter and lifeguard and Tracker, which are all just variations on that theme, fall 2024 will have only two shows that don't fit: Superman & Lois, and The Librarians: The Next Chapter. \n\nLong seasons coming out once a year create familiarity and comfort and deep engagement with the fictional environment that shows today can't match. I am attached to the characters and the world of The West Wing in a way that I am not attached to the characters on, say, Yellowjackets, because I spent 154 episodes with one group and 19 episodes with another. Silo will never have the time to devote to little character moments in the way Buffy: The Vampire Slayer did. Peacemaker will never get to build a large cast of secondary characters who get time to shine the way Star Trek: The Next Generation did. The new shows don't make enough episodes in a season, they don't make seasons often enough, and they stick to serialized plots too much to allow for that kind of connection with the audience. \n\nBut again, don't read that as pessimism. I love Yellowjackets and Silo and Peacemaker. I don't want those shows to not exist, or even for those shows to change. I am just pointing out that there is this other good thing we used to have that is disappearing.",

Also we now know most streaming services are struggling to even break even and are cutting back production even more. Match that with cable/syndicated viewership dying that clips production even more... Oh and strikes affect production even more which is a result of corporations keeping the profit/ad revenue away from the people who write/act/shoot shows. Friends cast still make cash from syndication, not too many shows today such as Silo or Peacemaker will be selling commercials in 20 years. So yeah money is different today.",

For most of Beth\u2019s life, chess was perceived as an all-consuming competition to be the best,  mostly from outside sources, which is what led her to those pills: a way to avoid the trauma of her childhood to focus entirely on winning the next match. Which I think is what you picked up on with Benny: one of the only times she was internally motivated rather than externally pressured was with him and sober, only for him to bring it right back to that external pressure. When her friend (name escapes me) comes back to visit her while she\u2019s struggling with the pills and alcohol, one of the things they do is to confront Beth\u2019s past without the substances to cloud her.\n\nAll of this comes down to her final tournament where she goes sober. She wants to win but now that she\u2019s accepted her past and ignoring external forces, she no longer needs the substances to mimic the sensation of having her mind clear; the pressure is finally handled. The show ends with her getting out of a limo with her agent who tied her win to press appearances and the like, what would put that pressure right back on her. She instead goes to play with the people in Russia who play for nothing but love of the game, effectively closing the loop on why she started playing. No more pressure, no more pills, just Beth\u2019s loved hobby that she now plays on her terms.",

Taking notice of their dumb smirk, they see their salvation. Falling into a trip, suddenly the gaps between their teeth become the board and they see the moves they need to make to win. \n\nComing back down to reality, with one final grin, they reach down for their final piece before collapsing and an ambulance has to be called.",

Sedol retired early as a consequence marking the beginning of a new era in AI that humans believed computers programs were undefeatable... Until 2023 when that all changed.\n\nTitle: Go Get Good Kid\n\nPlot: Kellin Pelrine is a young down on his luck PHD candidate and amateur go player who became obsessed with research being undertaken by Adam Gleaves, a hotshot AI research company CEO who was convinced he'd found a fatal flaw in Go playing AI defenses. Hopped up on Mountain Dew and Adderall, Kellin spent days memorising Adams findings in order to become the first human player to beat an AI consistently in the past 8 years. The tactic? Trap the AI in a loop of stones that it never sees coming. But a shady AI company with questionable motifs was right on their tale and desperate to stop the pair releasing their findings to the world at all costs. They destroyed Adams original findings and burnt the research, but they failed to account for the last remaining copy of this knowledge before a public playoff took place, Kellins photographic memory.",

A lot of the content matched other reporting of Fukishima I had read over the years, but I don't want to claim that it was 100% accurate and didn't omit anthing. \n\nThe scientists didn't try to hide it, but they were disbelieving of how bad it was getting, and very few people knew how to manage a situation of that severity. Obviously, they overall handled it well, and massively better than Chernobyl did, but there is a lot of drama, tension, and mistakes to mine from the events",

There is so much good stuff to watch nowadays and in my personal opinion, Apple has been producing a lot better high quality content versus the usual suspects like HBO, let alone the inconsistent mishmash from Netflix we\u2019ve all come to expect. Apple has been killing it; whoever is in charge of their streaming service and creative direction, please give them a raise.\n\nRegarding the show, I was also influenced into watching it because I was captivated by the setting and culture of Japan and Korea having watched Pachinko and Tokyo Vice a year back, so I knew it wouldn\u2019t let me down. The show is basically about wine, the wine culture, the wine business or what have you, but at the heart of it, it is about a father\u2019s unconditional love and a daughter attempting to reconcile what that exactly is/was while confronting her past, all while being nicely wrapped up by the setting and culture of Japan. The show is also mostly in French and Japanese so be prepared for subtitles.",

I think there is another sequel manga, but beyond that I really don't want it taken further. I'm dying for streamers to let a good linear show be one or 2 seasons and then leave it alone.",

                "comment_text": "Shizuku is the son of the most important wine critic in Japan - but he works in the sales department of a beer company and has never drunk wine in his life. As a teenager, after many educational and gourmet trips with his widowed father, Shizuku wanted to forge his wn path. Then, the millionaire critic suddenly dies of prostate cancer at the age of 67, and at the reading of the will, a stranger is invited, too: Issei Tomine is Japan's most important young wine expert.\n\nShizuku's father recently adopted Issei. Next, he wrote poetic, vague descriptive texts for twelve wines, which he sees as \"apostles\" and disciples (crowding around a Jesus-like \u201edrops of God\u201c he does not specify yet) - wines that are hard to pinpoint based on the descriptions alone. Issei and Shizuku have a good three weeks per \"apostle\" to name a candidate wine, taste it in front of the notary and describe it in their own words. Whoever names more apostles correctly inherits the wine cellar, the huge house/estate, and other properties. And maybe dad's respect?\n\n\"Drops of God\" is a manga for adults... and unfortunately much too didactic, dry and full of half-baked and dry digressions about wine culture. Starting in 2004, 44 volumes were published; and in the finale it is still unclear (after many detours, cheap coincidences, sexist supporting roles and wine recommendations full of involuntarily funny superlatives) what the \"drops of God\" are. A direct sequel called \"Mariage\" is about harmony (and actual marriage?) and matching in wines and menus. It has 26 volumes, but is not yet translated. The original is a bestseller in France, found a smaller audience of fans in the US and was also (partially) adapted into a short Japanese live-action series in 2009.\n\n\"Drops of God\" was written and drawn by the siblings Yuko and Shin Kibayashi, whose expertise and love of wine is abundantly clear - and no recent text about wines and wine-culture has been more influential, especially for the Asian wine market. So \"Drops of God\" is interesting for wine fans - but in terms of literature it still lags far behind many other manga series that are published by the same publisher and for the same target group (e.g. \"Space Brothers\" and \"Billy Bat\"): it\u2018s rather boring one and woodenly staged, a repetitive and often formulaic parade of wine decriptions without much deeper psychology - it\u2018s tiredly episodic and patriarchal, and the interesting character dynamics are never fully explored.\n\nIn 2023 - a full 19 years after volume 1 - \"Drops of God\" becomes a Japanese-French and pointedly more feminist new prestige series: eight episodes on Apple TV+, by French author Quoc Dang Tran (\"Call my Agent\"). Like in the manga, Issei is reserved, ambitious and often only present on the fringes of the plot in short scenes. But while the original celebrates widly kitschy doggedness and over-the-top clich\u00e9 extremes like \"Issei climbs the Matterhorn alone or almost dies of thirst in the desert when bandits attack a caravan - because such extremes help geniuses to understand the depth of a wine!\", TV-Issei struggles with the expectations of a nasty grandfather, his mother's machinations and the media's idea of having to win the wine guessing game \"for Japan\".\n\nFriendly, open \u201ebeer boy\u201c buddy Shizuku does not exist in the TV version - instead, there is Camille L\u00e9ger from France, daughter of wine critic Alexandre. Most of the characters in the TV drama are from Europe: Heroine Camille, her wine \u201epope\u201c of a father plus Luca, operator of a wine restaurant in Tokyo, waiter Lorenzo, and Thomas - son of a winegrower and Camille's first trainer in recognizing wines by their smell. A good half of the scenes are set on French wineries, in Paris or in Italy; and just like in the Korean-Japanese Apple series \"Pachinko\", \"Drops of God\" stands out with engaging and complex multilingual scenes: French, Japanese, and a lot of English. \n\nWesternizing the characters of the manga is eurocentric, and Issei's half (third? quarter!) of the series in particular seems sidelined and sort of stereotypic for far too long into the show. Camille as the lead is gorgeous, vivacious, funny, and engaging, and while the manga keeps finding apologies for the controlling father and lets all the women who might question him die, paints them as witches or denotes them to extras, the series is quick to ask: Did Camille experience violence and abuse when Alexandre pushed her to recognize scents of wines while she was still a child? Episode 1 of the series stages Camille's childhood as a tight (and cheerless, somewhat over-the-top) psychological drama, and now in her mid-20s, she is still getting nosebleeds and faints from alcohol. \n\nBut then the series quickly becomes brighter, wittier, more hopeful - because a Camille keeps openly asking \"What is this Shit?\" among wine snobs and questions the somewhat snooty tone and the challenge. Her attitude is much more fun (and subversive) than Shizuku\u2018s friendly, laid-back eventual praise of his dead father's \u201ewisdom and foresight\u201c plus Shizuku mostly just saying \"challenge accepted!\" instead of asking whether wine culture is toxic and his childhood was traumatizing. \n\nAll in all, the \"Drops of God\" show takes a lot of time to improve all the weaknesses and gaps in the manga in particularly engaging and inviting ways and can grab the attention of a mainstream audience: what seems lifeless or constructed in the manga is intended to vibrate, shine and, in particular, speak to those parts of the audience who are NOT taken by wine culture and romanticized drinking and overspending. \"Drops of God\" is a series with a very distinct basic idea - and it unfolds cleverly, charmingly and with more and more heart and humour: a stunned and disgusted Camille stands in the elite world of her father and then makes this world her own. Anyone who finds \"geniuses\" and \"big critics\" pretentious can laugh, cheer and cheer a lot here. A feel-good series for the general public - sensual, easy to \u201edrink\u201c, charming and optimistic!",

I see a lot of how HBO is obviously better and I just feel like I'm losing my mind.\n\nLike honestly do people just forget the absolutely insane catalog that Netflix has? Like is it because it's a binge watch type of service that people just forget the amount of things that Netflix has produced? If you look at it, I don't even think the variety and amount of good shows even compares. \n\nI'll just name the shows they have produced that I have liked off the top of my head\n\nStranger things\nOzark\nHouse of cards\nUmbrella academy \nQueens Gambit\nMind Hunter\nYou\nPeaky blinders\nSquid game\nArcane \nSex Education\nDark\nMaid\nDead to me\nAtypical\nLove death and robots\nWednesday\nGlow\nNarcos\nQuiet place\nBojack horseman \nAmerican vandal\nGlass onion\n\nThat barely scratches the surface. Those are the shows that I liked that I can remember. These shows and movies are just such a huge variety and of good quality that I don't think any other network can compare. And these are the shows that I liked, let alone the amount of programs that they make that are for other audiences.\n\nSure they cancel shows and some shows and movies will be bad and miss. But at least Netflix gives all these shows and movies a chance, many of which may never have seen the screen.",

They\u2019ve begun to alienate a lot of the creatives that had wanted to work with them. And they\u2019ve been developing a worrying hit or nothing mentality, where they are far stricter on what they renew. \n\nHBO, Hulu, AppleTV+ all have much brighter futures. And Peacock and Paramount+ are both so new that they don\u2019t deserve the same level of scrutiny as Netflix.\n\nI get looking at their past catalogue to see an impressive resume. (You forgot to add The Crown to that list btw). But when the success of streaming is so dependant on the future and the present, and Netflix\u2019s present and future look so dire, especially for the level of attention and importance they have in the culture. The backlash they\u2019ve been getting is really understandable.\n\nEdit: Also if your looking for a great read on Netflix, check out the New Yorker article titled \u201cHow Much Netflix Can The World Absorb\u201d",

It also doesn't help that every show I've started on Netflix in the past year, besides The Sandman, was cancelled. It also doesn't help that Netflix canned 24 series that started in 2022, as I find it increasingly difficult to bother with any show. \n\nBut, it's good you still see value in it.

It's got to compete with other streamers and it's never going to get that full percentage of the market back. \n\nBut it'll still be fine in the same way that NBC or CBS would be fine back in the days of network television. It's gotten too big to fail and it won't fail unless there's some huge technological leap, similar to how Netflix itself changed the game.",

That makes sense. It's still a shitty replacement for actually reading a critic and getting to understand their reasoning, but it makes sense in terms of \"do most of these folks actually like this thing to some degree.\" \n\nAudience aggregates isn't for accurately reflecting audience reaction.

Your two reviews will say the same thing on the surface, that you didn't find the character likable, but jonjon wasn't actually giving her a chance before judging her.\n\nLook at the different tones of you two's responses to me. Yours is stating calmly that you're not a bigot and that you didn't find her personality engaging. You felt like I was saying \"everyone who doesn't like it is sexist\" and objected to that characterization.\n\nJonjon, by comparison, stated very assertively but without any details that there were \"lots of reasons\" to dislike the character and the show she's in. That aggressively toned vagueness is a habit you see a lot of online. It's what happens when a person knows the details aren't going to make them look good so they hide the details and hope that other people will identify with the end position, get swept up in the drama, and join their side of the fight. \n\nRecognizing the red flag, you can then verify that hunch by looking at their comment history. [And, hey, after five seconds' worth of of looking he's unambiguously racist and transphobic](https://www.reddit.com/user/jonjonUKOK/?sort=controversial). \n____\nPeople like jonjon are why the dislike is *disproportionate*, not why the dislike exists at all.",

I'm only a few episodes on , but they've done an amazing job with the tone, casting, the story - everything.\n\nI'm so glad the series creators didn't feel the need to reinvent/reimagine the show like so many of the recent big adaptations have been. \n\nIts very simple - take a good book, get good actors, a screenwriter/creator who doesn't want to 'create' their own show, and get out of the way of the actual authors work. Another example of this is 'Queens Gambit' which no surprise was also highly rated and enjoyable.\n\nUnlike say Foundation, Wheel of Time, Witcher whose creators thought they were better than the authors of works that are critically acclaimed and loved by millions, and decided to 'adapt' it for 'modern' audiences with every kind of PC cliche etc. People will say those are works of scifi/fantasy and much more complex but the real answer is you need to have respect for the source material and passion. These could've been so much better.\n\nCongrats to Amazon and the team behind this show. And lets not have any talk of Cruise - his films are their own thing and were also well made and enjoyable.\n\nedit - special mention for Willa Fitzgerald she brings a lot to her role.",

The most recent one by Childs and his brother was particularly straightforward and dull - like reading a long overdetailed diary entry from someone with OCD and anger issues.\n\nThe efforts and changes inherent in adaptation are necessary. You can't just take Dune and use the book as the script, nor can you with most adaptations of source material. Foundation obviously pivoted hard away from the narrative content of the source material, but I don't think it was unsuccessful because of it. Similarly the decisions made for the LoTR films by Peter Jackson are highly regarded - not everyone gives a shit about Tom Bombadil and he isn't in any way relevant to the narrative as presented by the film version/s.\n\nI hope that the new Reacher TV series is everything the fans wanted, but the books themselves are popcorn/auto-pilot distractions and not particularly interested in telling a deeper moral tale or creating discussions on topical issues. Writing a book that is oven-ready for being adapted to a similarly pulpy medium of action-thriller television isn't that ingenious, and the cynic in me wonders whether Lee Childs had always had it in mind how translatable and sellable the character was as a direct-to-DVD action-man.",

Jack Reacher is great, but it\u2019s airport literature \u2014 basically a thriller in book form. Frankly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting at the heart of why the WoT, Foundation, and Witcher adaptations had pitfalls, because it most definitely wasn\u2019t because they have \u201cPC cliches\u201d or whatever (assuming you mean that they have non-straight and diverse people in their cast). Foundation is one of those books that\u2019s hard to adapt as an episodic series with an overarching plot because the scope of the book is tremendous, despite it being so small. The creators of the series were presented with either making an anthology-type series with a loose plot binding it together, or changing the book to make it more of a coherent episodic series. They chose the latter, and frankly it sucked because of that because the scope is what\u2019s attractive.\n\nWheel of Time has the opposite challenge \u2014 the books are huge, and frankly a good part of those books is just extra BS. Though it does have things dragging it down aside from it \u2014 the actors are okay to mediocre with only a couple of notable exceptions and the visual effects look really awkward \u2014 the main difficulty is the pacing, because in their effort to cut out a lot of the BS Jordan put in they ran through the first book way too fast. I still have hope for this though and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re at least trying to meet the challenge.\n\nWon\u2019t comment much on Witcher because I haven\u2019t read the source material, only to say that the flaws I\u2019ve noticed with it have zilch to do with the diversity of the cast, more the directing choices. Ciri constantly having perfect makeup despite being out in the dirt all the time, for example.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a fantastic adaptation \u2014 the recent Dune. It has a diverse cast, certainly more so than what Herbert had pictured I think, and I think that\u2019s an improvement. More than that though, it manages to be its own thing while staying loyal to the source material because it doesn\u2019t try to be the source material. While most of the book is spent on characters\u2019 internal or external dialogue, the movie spends more time on visuals to convey how the characters relate to each other and the new world they\u2019re in. It\u2019s different from the book, but it\u2019s absolutely fantastic \u2014 seeing the first time a sandworm comes out and eats the spice collector is probably the most memorable moment in a movie for me in years. The movie was loyal to the book\u2019s spirit, its themes, and its character, but it also wasn\u2019t exactly like the book, and I think that\u2019s a fantastic way to do an adaptation \u2014 but it was also very hard to pull off.",

                "comment_text": "I have now watched the first 4 episodes, and its decent. However there are glaring issues regarding some \"facts\", especially surrounding firearms and ballistics, something which I specialize in. In fact within 30 minutes of the 1st episode I found the first major flaw where Reacher says \"This was a professional killer, using 95 grain subsonic 9mm bullets with a suppressor\".  \n\n\nA professional killer would know that 95 grains for a 9mm is LIGHT, bordering on very light and would be designed to operate at high velocities not low velocities where the use of a suppressor would make someone very quiet.   \n\n\nSuppressors dampen the noise (visual and auditory) by trapping expanding gasses and allowing unburnt powder in the barrel that would otherwise ignite in the air causing a muzzle flash to ignite in the baffles of the suppressor, thus reducing or in some cases eliminating the muzzle flash. Auditory suppression is based on many variables, but the leading would be if the round is supersonic or not, as a bullet going supersonic makes are rather loud sonic boom or a sonic \"crack\" as it sounds like.  \n\n\nMy point is no \"professional\" would \"cold load\" a 95 grain JHP as they would be reducing their KE (kinetic energy) effectiveness, because energy matters in terminal performance. If you were to cold load a 95 grain bullet and a 158 grain bullet which would still likely be Subsonic in a +P loading, the 158 grain bullet is going to hit MUCH harder, and is designed to operate at lower speeds including subsonic, thus increasing terminal effectiveness.  \n\n\nSo in all reality, a professional killer would know to use a 158 grain JHP in likely a +P format, around 1000 ft/s from a 4.5/5 inch full frame pistol with a threaded barrel to accommodate suppressor use. I am not sure if they consulted any ballisticians when filming or producing this show, but it certainly does not seem like it.  \n\n\nI would also like to point out that using Suppressors does not make it harder to \"use a gun or be accurate\". Suppressors do change the POI (Point Of Impact) which is more pronounced at range, and they often make the weapons longer (unless integral to the barrel), and increase their overall weight, but the increased weight helps mitigate recoil, so its a positive, not a negative.  \n\n\nJust my nerdy 2 cents.",

It ended up not being my cup of tea.  I thought the characters and plot were rather juvenile.  I don't mean to insult fans of the series, so don't take it personally.  It was all just a bit too simplistic for me.  Reacher as a character is exactly what Lee Child envisioned him as -- imposing, smart, fearless, tough, never loses a fight, is never scared, knows how to do basically everything, never suffers from self doubt, and I found that to be terribly boring.  But the story does very well what he intended it to do, so I can't fault it, it's just not the kind of thing I'm into, as opposed to, say, MacDonald's Travis McGee (to whom Reacher probably owes a lot of his existence).\n\nAnyway, I've watched half of the first season of the Reacher series, and I find it impressive how precisely they've adapted the novel.  Production values are great, the story is more or less exactly off the page, and the performances are top notch.  I don't consider the precise adaptation, however, to be a benefit to the show.  I think if I had to review the series in two words, it would be \"gloriously awful.\"  \n\nI've seen the two Cruise movies (I actually thought he played the character well despite being no taller than a garden gnome), and I'll definitely finish the series.  I'm honestly enjoying it for the badness of the writing and the earnestness of the production.  If that sounds like damning with faint praise, I apologize.  There are a lot of very successful classic action films with horrendously juvenile writing (Star Wars comes to mind, and anything with the Avengers), so when I say \"gloriously awful\" it puts it in a kind of category for me of films/shows that are great despite how bad they are.  I don't know if that makes any sense.\n\nAnd now I kind of want to read the second book in the series.  Hopefully the show gets picked up for another season.  I imagine if you're a fan of the books, the adaptation is sticking you right in the feels, because it's honestly one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen.",

Jack Reacher is supposed to have vast experience in the military and military police.  The character also has firearms experience.  There is NO WAY the character would have called a sound suppressor a \"silencer.\"  In fact, such a straight-talking character would have at least corrected someone using that word, if not outright laughed in their face.  However, as written this character doesn't laugh much.",

Ritchson is perfect for Reacher (clever camera work makes him look even bigger than his 6'2\" but Jesus he's a big lad!) and I cannot get over how well they've done what makes Reacher what he is - someone with an unflinching moral code that has zero restraint and the training and ability to take immediate and brutal physical action with zero angst. The trailers made some of the dialogue a little cheesy but in when it was in context it was superb. You're absolutely right that he nails Reacher.\n\nYou also can't not talk about the Cruise films. He's an incredible actor, one of the best of his generation, but the Cruise Reacher films had zero Reacher to them. It could have been any nameless smart ex-mil loner in those stories and other than the underlying plot felt completely disconnected from the world Lee Child has created.\n\nAlso I cannot compliment Willa Fitzgerald enough who makes Roscoe a complete badass but with incredible depth. I can't believe she's not already famous as she kills in this role.",

I'd watch him beat up dudes over Dwayne the Rock Johnson any day. However the show made the viewer take too many leaps to rationalize things that would or could never happen. A lot of plot holes. But again, it was super entertaining and worth the watch! \n*They made so many references to his height at 6'5\" which I thought was amazing, every time it felt like they were cheap shotting TC (that other guy who shall not be named that played Reacher) because he's like 5'5\" irl. Ritchson was a beast, and a great, accurate, Reacher. I could see him playing a Marvel hero now, maybe the next Drax since Bautista isn't reprising role after gotg3. I could see him playing many other though.",

Reacher is quite an obscure IP and basically unknown outside of US, despite of what fans claim.

Anyone with even a passing knowledge of WoT lore would realise how absolutely nonsensical that is. \n\nA major male character has the apex of his story arc in the first book - an essential and game changing moment - taken from him and given to some of the female characters. It's akin to Frodo and Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom and right before Sam gives his \"I can carry you\" speech, Arwen shows up, says \"I can take it from here lads!\" and chucks the ring in the volcano. \n\nWhile I agree that a lot of the complaining about \"PC choices\" in recent media is driven by racism and assholes being assholes, it's crazy to deny that this stuff is going on. Diversifying popular properties is seen as a way to bring in additional fans but it almost always fails because, aside from being unbelievably patronising to the non-represented groups involved, it's the hard-core fans that drive early word of mouth and promotion for a show. That's why Game of Thrones succeeded, and it's why WoT will fizzle out next season.\n\nSee also: casting Idris Elba as Roland in The Dark Tower; a character whose whiteness is an important plot point and a huge source of conflict with one of the other characters who would have been in the sequels.",

The above 2 shows seem to have been written with a wilful, gleeful disregard for book readers and their creators seem to insult the book fans and tell them to 'grow up'.\n\nIts not THAT hard to adapt a complex book series. What is needed is to distill it but leave the main tone intact, to not make massive gender/race changes to serve some agenda, and then to defend these. The reaction from book readers and anyone who's not a casual is uniformly that these shows are terrible. And very similar for Witcher but its higher quality.",

There are also several where someone from Reacher's past looks him up and brings him in to help with something, along with a few \"prequel\" books set back when he was in the military.\n\nVery fun books.

Even in the NFL, there a very few guys that tall, buff, and pretty obviously experienced in a fight/combat. I think it's the overall combination of things. It's one thing to be tall. It's one thing to be yoked. It's one thing to be obviously experienced when it's comes to fighting. But all of it together is pretty intimidating.

Cruise brought legitimacy to the role from a movie making perspective, so I looked past his casting and was able to enjoy the films for what they were, instead of how they were originally written.  Never really felt like a true Reacher to me, but the movies were still entertaining.",

We could also argue that the author's original intent is always destroyed via the process of adaptation as they created something in one medium over another - Isaac Asimov didn't write Foundation as a series of TV screenplays, but a series of novels. \n\nSomething will always be lost or changed, whether by the different social/political landscape that the new version will exist in, or by the new authors deciding on changes they think would be better or more interesting for an audience.\n\nRegarding the \"gleeful disregard for book readers\" - good! They are not owners of any piece of published media, and the baggage that they bring as fans with their own imaginings of how a character should look or behave or sound is an impossible challenge to overcome. Furthemore, does it matter that Tom Cruise isn't 7-foot tall? It's an adaptation. I don't recall reading a Jack Reacher book and it actually mattering that he was 7-foot tall, it's just another example of the lazy writing of Lee Childs to create an \"intimidating\" character through visuals in a non-visual medium.\n\nAdaptations by their nature are for all audiences, and as such are most often accessible when they are simply well made and well told stories. The recent Cowboy Bebop was a shitshow - I'm a huge fan of the original anime so was already despondent. But I can argue strongly that it is not only a horrible adaptation, but also a terribly made TV programme. It's not bad because it isn't the original show I love, it's bad because it's poorly designed and poorly made.\n\nYour comment regarding \"massive gender/race changes\" smacks of personal issues that you can contend with yourself as it has little bearing on anything. Would Jack Reacher change a damn if he was black or of some Asian descent? He sticks out like a sore thumb anyway, so his race and gender have nothing to do with his character. Would it matter if Henry Cavill hadn't been cast as The Witcher and we had a female character in that role? Why couldn't an bad-ass outlier of society have a vagina, or be brown, or disabled?\n\nIt's a brave new world, and unless your story is specifically addressing something to do with gender or race, we should all welcome colour-blind casting and help present appropriate representation of the people who make up our multi-culutral multi-faceted Technicolor world.\n\nTL;DR: It is both hard and simple to make a good adaptation. New voices = new versions of stories. Fans of source material are not a definitive gauge of whether an adaptation works or not. #NotMyFredFlintstone is for fucking cavemen.",

Now, I'm one of the people who support the changes, because you have to cut like 75% of Wheel of Time to adapt it, so of course you have to change the story. \n\nMost discussions for Foundation have involved how it's wildly different from the books. It makes sense to me, because telling the story the way they are allows them to invest in certain actors to have better visual continuity. \n\nLikewise, Witcher has caught hell for deviating from the source material, and it's to the extent that the showrunners are promising fans they'll correct course in the next season. \n\nConsidering those are three of the highest profile novel adaptations in the world right now, it makes perfect sense that *Reacher* would be celebrated for adherence to the source material. And it makes perfect sense that, in lieu of fan complaints about the Jack Reacher **films** deviating from the source material, the television show would use its longer format to lean in to the source material. \n\nThese are all very reasonable and interesting points to make, and there's absolutely no reason to think such a discussion would be the work of shills.",

Phillips disagreed, finding that Gaprindashvili had made a plausible argument that she was defamed. Phillips also held that works of fiction are not immune from defamation suits if they disparage real people.\n> \n> **\u201cNetflix does not cite, and the Court is not aware, of any cases precluding defamation claims for the portrayal of real persons in otherwise fictional works,\u201d Phillips wrote. \u201cThe fact that the Series was a fictional work does not insulate Netflix from liability for defamation if all the elements of defamation are otherwise present.\u201d**",

They showed him evacuating passengers in the movie but he's shown to lose it and shoot people. It's hard to confirm whether it really happened or not but his family dispute that story.\n\nIsmay is show sneaking past women and children even though he was known to have saved many passengers and left on the last lifeboat available. Cameron told historical consultants that people expect the ship owner to be a villain. Pretty much every movie about the Titanic uses him as a villain just because he was the main authority figure.",

Of course the storyteller has to fit the story; however, if that was the case why was it necessary to acknowledge a specific person with a false claim? A different name would have sufficed so while the creator may have seen at as a nod towards them despite the fact that it is quite dismissive of the actual chess player's accomplishments. \n\n\nI'm not well versed in chess historical figures, but using their name and presenting them in a false Iight that is not overly satirical it is a particularly dangerous precedent to set considering the online age. I have nothing to back this up but I think it's reasonable to assume woman chess player searches increased a ton over the Queen's gambit release, and in that there is a misrepresented and tarnished representation from reality. With that without very obviously being satirical and using them as a point of false reference is dangerous. Maybe, maybe, we shouldn't be using media to push false truths on impressionable people that will take it as fact. There is some sense of responsibility for real people to be represented accurately. Maybe not.\n\n\nI guess it is a work of fiction, but it seems like there is certainly a line that creators will be teetering on if they aren't already now.\n\n\nEdit; very obvious typos and spacing issues to resolve",

This should be pretty easy to prove if she had been getting invites previously\u2026she was attending chess awards ceremonies as recent as 2015/2016 and was in a documentary in 2021 so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s totally old news.  Her perfume line in the shape of a chess queen might even still be around.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to pretend a lot of the chess personalities don\u2019t exist when you\u2019re co-opting their real life stories(ie, how the book ignores the existence of Fischer and has Beth take a lot of his story), it\u2019s another to put a name down to dismiss.",

To me, the Netflix producers went so far as to hire professional chess consultants, so they clearly would've known that the statements they were making were false.\n\n>I don't know about the legal merit either, but the splitting of hairs here seems rather strange.\n\nThe splitting of hairs is kind of their job. It's a small difference to us laypeople, but the lawyers and the judge think it's a big enough difference to let the arguments be made in court. So let them. I'm not a lawyer and skimming through the wikipedia page shows how many legal precedents seemingly rely on various subtleties and unimportant minutiae.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law\n\nIMHO even if it turns out that they didn't do anything *legally* wrong, the show producers did something that is *ethically* wrong, by knowingly, unnecessarily and damagingly lying about the accomplishments of a real person, which is why I hope there is *some* legal and financial consequences for their actions. Not devastating consequences, but substantial enough to discourage other producers from doing the same.",

The shitty part is this means there is no finality to any of their stories. Five episodes in they'll introduce new character who doesn't really matter, but they have a couple scenes that implies they are important and they leave without really doing anything.\n\nCompared to a random show like Queen's Gambit that just tells a story. Imagine if they had a young character with a useless side story that just implies he's gonna be good at chess one day and ends there.  \n\n\nOh and Cobra Kai was cool, but it's probably the worse offender these days. Daniel is like \"oh no, I tried to take down Cobra Kai and failed.... I'm gonna try to take down Cobra Kai now...\" Then a new side story pops up, and everyone is still mad at each other.",

That's cool you know what you like.\n\nEvery Disney+ Marvel & Star Wars show I've watched thus far has had a pretty satisfactory story line.  They are all part of big franchises so of course they will do something extra to make it worth it to those following everything by tying things together.   I'm confused though which series you feel didn't have a decent end?  Hawkeye was about the resurgence of the Ronin suit which reignited a feud Ronin (Clint Barton) had with the Track Suit Mafia as well as crime organizations in general.  It put Kate in the crossfire thus he stuck around to get back the suit and ultimately destroy it and end the hunt for Ronin.  It also doubled as an origin story for Kate, which is from the comics and has been around for nearly 17 years.  End of season 2 of Mandalorian had the child getting to where he vowed to deliver him.   Wandavision was about the grief of loss Wanda went through.  It wrapped to some degree with healing and stopping the whole town from being mind controlled.   Falcon & Winter Soldier was about dealing with the aftermath and displacement caused by those that vanished in the blip coming back.  It told a very complete story and gave birth to the next Captain America.  What If actually had a central story line and it all came together at the end brilliantly.    Loki showed us how the timeline was being controlled to prevent multiple universes... and explored the character in levels none of the previous movies could.   Yes they all introduced characters that could be used in future content.  Because these aren't one off mini-series, but part of something bigger.  So it's easier to criticize on that merit.   I love it though.  It's not just some standalone forgettable side story, but it actually plays into the franchise.   Cobra Kai is one of the most masterfully created shows.  It depicts how anyone can be seen as the bad guy while feeling justified or even the good guy... and even come to the realization of going down a wrong path.  The way they've tied to the original movies and keeping true to that while existing in modern times is something to applaud.  They aren't telling a one season story and done... nor are they trying to milk things for more and more seasons.  There is a story planned out here.  It would have sucked if they just did a single season mini-series and been done.",

        "text": "I totally respect that people enjoy Succession but I honestly can\u2019t wrap my head around why. I get that the acting is a major factor but there\u2019s nothing else there (in the first three episodes which were all that I gave it). \n\nWe get Kendall who is obviously emotionally manipulated by his father and has this major complex of filling in his dads shoes while being totally incapable of being that person. Then there\u2019s Shiv, who, at least in the first three, has little to give to us to root for but also no negatives to dislike her. Then there\u2019s Roman and Logan. Two major pieces of shit who treat everyone around them terribly and feel entitled to the world. Roman is just the absolute worst. When they played the game and he ripped up the million dollar check in front of that poor kids face to really make him feel bad for losing, not just losing the game but losing the million dollar opportunity for his family, a position that Roman forced him into. Greg is great because he\u2019s trying to make his way into the company but has barely any social skills so he ends up looking like an idiot. So I root for Greg, and I feel bad for Kendall but I just don\u2019t care that much about their plights anyway because it\u2019s just about money. They aren\u2019t trying to save the world or protect their family. It\u2019s still just centered around money. And I get it, that\u2019s the whole point; money and power, and I guess daddy\u2019s approval. The plot isn\u2019t thick enough either, so that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s bringing people back.\n\nThese characters are all basically the Lannister\u2019s, whom we\u2019ve all learned to love over the course of the four seasons before the show was tragically cancelled. The major difference is we have sympathetic characters right off the bat in Ned, Robb, Arya, Jon, Cat, and Dany to root for because we want them to succeed. We want to know what happens next because we care about their well-being. We quickly love Tyrion because while he is Lannister in name, he hardly is in personality and in his actions. He shows kindness and has a tragic story. He\u2019s a rich boy but he\u2019s clearly suffering despite his wealth. We enjoy scenes with Tywin because he has a commanding presence, but if that\u2019s all we had, I don\u2019t think I would care. I didn\u2019t watch Game of Thrones to see what happened to Tywin, especially not in season 1 (I forget if he\u2019s even in season 1). We hate Jaime and Cercei in the beginning because they\u2019re essentially the villains. There are also mysteries abound that we want to know how they unfold. We also get a great supporting cast whom we also care about. \n\nNow, this isn\u2019t meant to jerk off GoT but to show that you need characters to love to root for them, or at least I do. \n\nI know a counter argument can be made that It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has a cast of unlikeable characters and I do believe it is one of the greatest comedy series of all time. The reason isn\u2019t because we care about them though, it isn\u2019t because of an intriguing plot, but simply because the jokes and plots are so hilarious that you enjoy the whole ride.\n\nThe pros of both of these shows do not apply to Succession in my opinion. We don\u2019t have enough to care about, and the humor isn\u2019t present enough to be the main factor that keeps me watching. I could enjoy these characters more if I had better characters to root for, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any aside from Greg who is basically just funny Jon Snow, at least in the comparison to GoT. I\u2019m just glad GoT never got far enough to be ruined by bad writing and at least we can remember the time we had with it fondly.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve finished the series and feel pretty stupid for having gone through and watched it all for no reason. Everything I felt about the first few episodes never went away, I just learned to cope with. Trust me, it\u2019s not worth it. And to those of you who love the show, at this point I\u2019m speaking to people who started it and can\u2019t get into it and are searching for a Reddit thread discussing why people like it. That\u2019s the only reason anyone comes to this thread anymore anyway.\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people still comment here I\u2019m going to leave a list of shows that are vastly superior to Succession that I highly recommend you watch instead:\n\nDrama\n\n- The Wire\n\n- The Americans\n\n- The Leftovers\n\n- Mr Robot\n\n- Black Sails\n\n- Mad Men\n\n- Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul\n\n- Atlanta \n\n- The Underground Railroad\n\n- Boardwalk Empire\n\n- Deadwood\n\n- Justified\n\n- Dark\n\n- Halt and Catch Fire \n\n- Narcos\n\n- Fargo\n\nComedy/Dramedy\n\n- Barry \n\n- Fleabag\n\n- The Good Place\n\n- Glow\n\n- You\u2019re the Worst\n\n- Veep\n\n- 30 Rock\n\n- Arrested Development\n\n- Community\n\n- Bojack Horseman\n\n- Scrubs\n\n- Seinfeld\n\n- Curb Your Enthusiasm\n\n- Cowboy Bebop\n\n- It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia \n\nHow about some miniseries?\n\n- Chernobyl\n\n- True Detective (season 1 only)\n\n- The Pacific\n\n- Band of Brothers\n\n- The Haunting of Hill House\n\n- The Haunting of Bly Manor\n\n- Midnight Mass\n\n- The Terror (season 1 only)\n\n- Watchmen (must read comic first, not the movie as it is not canon with the show)\n\n- I May Destroy You\n\n- The Night Of\n\n- Devs\n\n- Maniac\n\n- Catch 22\n\n- White Lotus (season 1, haven\u2019t watched season 2)\n\n- Queens Gambit\n\nThat\u2019s not an entirely comprehensive list but it should have a little of something on there for everybody. Except anime fans, sorry, I\u2019ve only watched Cowboy Bebop.",

I think for me its not that the characters are unlikeable, its that they are not fleshed out.  No matter how much screentime they have and 8 episodes is a lot of screentime, they don't seem real.  I only see actors and not the characters they are trying to portray.  The jokes aren't funny.  These are not portraits but grotesque caricatures.  The view is that all rich people are horrible humans, and that they have zero empathy for others.  It's like the old anitsemitic caricatures of the Jew with the long nose, only this time its the evil rich people and corporations.  They are dehumanized and therefore unrealistic and uninteresting.  Also the show lacks purpose and it repeats itself.  How many times do we see Roy's daughter cheat on her husband? There is no point to see this the 5th time.",

I\u2019m fine with unlikeable characters, but I at least need to care about them (Breaking Bad). The mains on Succession are just purely unlikeable, with no depth beyond that. Plus, everything is totally predictable. I *love* dark comedy, but don\u2019t think insulting \u201csarcastic\u201d language is creative or funny. I get that comedy needs conflict and high stakes, but Succession just feels like stress porn imo. HBO used to put forward original, indie series.

I watched one episode & hated it but after hearing about it nonstop came back for a second episode & found it to be torturous.  I get the \"you have to give some shows a while to grab you.\"  I don't know that I put The Wire in that category because i was hooked with that one right away (the dock season was in fact the low point there I thought). But I think many people said that about Breaking Bad & I found that to be the case (I thought that was ultimately one of the best series). Better Call Saul seemed even slower to start but got good (not as good as BB).  Anyway, yeah, it's always nice to see others are in this minority. I would 1000% rather just watch a documentary about Rupert Murdoch than watch this garbage.  I'm trying to understand why otherwise intelligent people are wasting so much time here...",

Maybe try Jesse' Armstrong's 'Peep Show' if you don't like Succession, there are tons of moral  and likeable characters there . I am kidding there are none there either LOL.",

Which is of course about \"Succession\", who will become the successor to this billion dollar media company who's run by a guy who's apparently an asshole to everyone around him, including his children who in turn are assholes but arguably lesser so. The draw for me is relating to having a parent who's toxic that you still want to prove yourself to for some reason as well who will become the successor as well seeing how the ultra wealthy live.

The back and forth of the kids maybe hating each other and then maybe liking each other has to be one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever seen. How can these characters consistently go back to their dad who they agree is shitty one scene and then next scene they wish Kendall was dead.\n\nWhat in the fuck. Then at the start of season 4 they\u2019re best friends all of a sudden after they got fucked over. Jesus Christ. Where is the development? Where is the gradual change? Where are the likable characters? Interesting characters or plot? Nowhere to be found. Season 2 was pretty decent I believe but oh my god everything else is just dogshit. Not even mentioning the fuckin handcam they were obsessed with like am I watching the office or a documentary with snap zooms? It\u2019s supposed to be a fucking drama. 2 episodes of season 4 and I skipped to the end and good christ, what a horrific ending. Absolutely unearned and so dumb.",

But when I tell you it has been an absolute struggle fest watching this show to the end and feeling no resolve. The ONLY thing I accomplished was wasting my f*cking time. I didn't care about the characters. Greg turned out to be just as sh*tty as the rest of them. The best parts of this show was when they were in shouting matches telling each other the absolute worst truths about themselves. And that was maybe the best writing of the whole thing. The money was a background character that ruled them.all, but didn't even make enough of an appearance for me to oogle over their riches. The characters sucked. The writing sucked. And the story sucked, right till the end.\nI I'll concede that the acting of Shiv and Roman when their father died actually pulled aheartstrings. Not for the old bastard, but for the acting abilities. Same with Kendall and Tom's perfect portrayal of lost, and hopeless within this show.\nAt this point,  all I can work with is the insight of how little the rich care for the non-rich and how many truly f*cked up words you can string together to create a Roman script.",

I got all the way through season one when it first released and have seen most of season two, but I wouldn\u2019t even have remembered the show if not for the fact that it became a cultural phenomenon for some reason. I don\u2019t find it repellent or offensive or shocking or anything, I just feel quite bored with the characters and the overall plot line. I don\u2019t really care about them, as they\u2019re not especially smart or funny or sexy or compassionate, and the stakes don\u2019t seem all that high to me and basically no one ever says anything clever. \n\nI\u2019ll confess that I\u2019m definitely influenced by the fact that they\u2019re a very tacky, nouveau riche form of a TV wealthy family, which makes me less interested in them than I might be otherwise, but it sort of feels like watching the Kardashians in that it feels infuriating to watch people with so much wealth who appear to have made no effort to become culturally literate in any meaningful way. Also, no one seems to be able to adequately explain or even theorize as to why the show is good except for vague illusions to the cinematography of the political topicality. \n\nI sort of wonder whether people have just been so thirsty for another big TV cultural phenomenon that they\u2019re grabbing onto this show because it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got right now? But the idea that this belongs anywhere near the category of shows like Breaking Bad, The Wire, Arrested Development, Twin Peaks, or Mad Men seems laughable to me. For my money, there\u2019s a lot more interesting ideas going on in Yellowjackets even though it can be somewhat stylistically derivative. Still, I feel like that show has a lot more vision and dramatic stakes in which I\u2019m invested. \n\nMaybe the HBO marketing team just needs to take a bow? I mean, they\u2019ve managed to sell a lot of reviewers on the idea that House of Dragon is just as good of Game of Thrones, even though it never even had the benefit that GOT did in its first 4 seasons in having actual GRRM dialogue. \n\nI think I would feel better about it if I thought the show was terrible or offensive to me in some way but, like HOD, it seems just fine to me and nothing more. Competent. Good enough for something to watch tonight, but not something I would recommend or even particularly remember well enough to recommend or not. \n\nIf there\u2019s a fan here, can you give me some example of interesting character development, witty/pithy dialogue, or just narrative craftsmanship that could make me appreciate the show more? I don\u2019t care about spoilers or any of that, so don\u2019t worry about ruining the plot development for me.",

I watched every bit of Succession and I want the time back. It should have ended on Season 3 and I think Brian Cox knows it was less than great. People try and make him out to be done sort of \"Curmudgeon\" but I think he is saying without saying that the show was not great, actually boring, and that he is glad it\u2019s over. I am actually at a point where when I hear or meet people that like it, I think they are kind of shallow. And I dont want to hear about anything else that they suggest.",

I am on season two episode three and I cannot f-ing stand it I mean I cannot stand it. I tried so hard I really did. But there\u2019s not one likable thing about any of these characters. Plus people keep giving Logan a chance after chance after chance not to be an asshole when that\u2019s all he can be. They seem to enjoy being humiliated. No one is that forgiving. Any normal person growing up in a dysfunctional family that\u2019s at all in touch with who they are would turn their back on these people as toxic. How there could be any benefit whatsoever in putting yourself in that situation and keeping yourself there is beyond me. Does it get better with season three? Season four? I do see the characters developing, but they are still unlikable assholes. And yeah, they seem to exhibit some intelligence, but overall they\u2019re just really really dumb to put themselves through what they are. I can\u2019t watch it any longer. Is the acting any good? I don\u2019t know. Individually I like many of the actors very much. Is the script any good? I don\u2019t know. I was in business for 30 years and I was never around people who talked like that, and I\u2019m not talking about the swearing. There was plenty of that. The language around business strategy just doesn\u2019t ring true from what I experienced in large corporations. But I wasn\u2019t in the upper echelons of executive management. I am disappointed that I\u2019m having to throw in the towel, but I already escaped my dysfunctional family, I feel like I need to escape this rich, fake dysfunctional family, it\u2019s that painful.",

The characters are completely hollow and unbelievable to the point that they seem like parodies of who they are supposed to be, ad libbing every line like it\u2019s completely unscripted.  The entire implausibility of every single aspect of the plot lines for each character and the show as a whole make it come off as if it were written by someone who has a mental illness with the vocabulary of a 3rd grader.  I made myself watch the first episode out of curiosity and then forced myself against my will to watch the second.  Couldn\u2019t bring myself to even start episode 3.  I have no idea why this dud of a show has so many followers and awards when there are SO many other shows that are infinitely better.  One of the best ones that I\u2019ve seen has been The Gilded Age.

I\u2019m just dumbstruck with the idea that it could become \u201cso good\u201d after the part I\u2019ve seen because the characters seem so shallow and the plot feels thin, and even if they add more facets to these characters I just don\u2019t know how anyone found the first few compelling enough to go on.

                "comment_text": "Ok, I appreciate this post. I can see the family dynamic/abuse phenomenon as a certain kind of draw. I do think that this is a topic that has had many more interesting treatments on film and TV, but it does feel like *Succession*\u2019s view of trauma is maybe more in line with contemporary notions as opposed to the shows/books/films like *Arrested Development*, *The Royal Tenenbaums*, and *Infinite Jest*, for example (though I would argue all of those works are not only funnier, but also more interesting and nuanced and moving treatments of the subject matter). This is before we even get into Russian social novels and plays by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov, or 20th century greats like Paula Fox (*Desperate Characters*)\n\nI guess I just feel like the stakes aren\u2019t all that high because any sensible person would accept whatever trust fund was on offer and basically keep her distance while remaining as cordial as possible so not to get sucked in. Like, I don\u2019t see why any of the characters particularly want what they\u2019re supposedly fighting over. Why wouldn\u2019t you use your privilege to actually enjoy life, pursue more worthwhile interests, or just try and make a family of your own with whom you could develop healthier relationships? \n\nI don\u2019t think character \u201clikability\u201d is a necessary or even particularly important quality for drama. Almost none of the acknowledged masterpieces of modern television focus on protagonists who are especially likable, but it does seem like it helps if the characters are somewhat insightful, talented, intelligent, or at least beautiful\u2014anything to make them unusual or especially interesting. Like, what makes these people worth telling a story about besides their wealth? Like, Charles Foster Kane in *Citizen Kane* behaves like a selfish and gaudy villain, but we\u2019re invested in him because we can see that he is, at least in his youth, a great man with interest ideas, beliefs and ambitions. Walter White is definitely not likable, but he\u2019s incredibly fascinating to watch as a person with complicated motivations and desires and beliefs. The same can be said for almost every member of the ensembles in *Mad Men*, *Twin Peaks*, *Yellowjackets*, and *The Wire*. I\u2019m genuinely compelled by the choices they make and invested in the outcome. \n\nI always felt like one of the great insights of Shakespeare was to write all his characters as more insightful and intelligent versions of the kind of people they actually represent because we easily suspend our disbelief on this point and we\u2019re rewarded with more complex and multilayered dynamics for doing so. Like, no one as young and inexperienced as Juliet would be able to articulate the sentiment \u201cparting is such sweet sorrow\u201d or to reflect that her \u201conly love sprung from [her] only hate, Too early seen unknown, and known too late!\u201d in the actual moment, but she\u2019s a more interesting character for being heightened in that way. Obviously I don\u2019t expect *Succession* to be Shakespeare or Tolstoy. I just never get the sense that *Succession* writes its characters to be the most interesting possible version of themselves. It\u2019s drama viewed as a lab rat experiment.",

If they can\u2019t make it interesting enough initially then that\u2019s just bad writing in my opinion. If it\u2019s only those first three that are written bad, then those are still bad, the later episodes don\u2019t retroactively make it good.

I still think Roman is incredibly overrated and it\u2019s annoying how much people love the character considering he\u2019s supposed to be a piece of shit. \n\nI\u2019ve caught up by now and just watched the most recent episode and I think the show overall is pretty good but all my points that I made in this post after watching 3 episodes still stand. I don\u2019t like anyone, I don\u2019t want to see them succeed and don\u2019t even care to see anyone fail. It\u2019s entertaining to see the power plays and all that but there\u2019s no emotion involved. Last episode was praised for how it was shot and how powerful the performances were - and those are valid praises - but the problem I had was I didn\u2019t feel for the characters at all when you obviously are supposed to. I get where their emotion is coming from, my father was abusive and neglectful but when he dies I\u2019m going to be destroyed, but that\u2019s not enough - to simply empathize. To truly feel those moments we needed to have built up care and concern for these characters, no matter how flawed, and at least in my case, I didn\u2019t. \n\nGoing back to the Game of Thrones comparison (which I feel is getting a bit tired but I\u2019m going to stick with it) Cersei Lannister is very comparable to Shiv. She\u2019s a woman in a man\u2019s world and tries hard to keep herself and her loved ones alive while also trying to make a play for power. As her various children died it was a tragedy; she had created the demise of her children while trying to protect them. Over the course of the show I empathized and even partly sympathized with Cersei, but I couldn\u2019t give a shit about Shiv. She has barely any characterization outside of her rivalry with her brothers, her issues with her father (which she shares with her brothers so it\u2019s hardly a unique aspect of her character), and she has relationship problems because of the former two issues. There\u2019s really not much more to her character, (though I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a plethora of in depth analysis videos of each characters psyche on YouTube) and that really just isn\u2019t enough to hold my attention for four seasons.",

I also cared about many supporting characters such as Chalky, Richard, and even Jimmy. Now, that honestly isn\u2019t as much of a problem in Boardwalk anyway because I found the characters to be far more interesting than any of those in Succession, most of whom I found to be boring and annoying.\n\nSuccession doesn\u2019t have to be funny, but it tries to be. I didn\u2019t find it to be nearly as funny as any of the shows I have in the comedy list above.\n\nOverall the plot is just far more interesting. I\u2019m invested in seeing whether Nucky finally gets his comeuppance, I loved watching Nelson Van Alden fail time and time again, and as I said before, hoped Margaret would survive Nucky and live a happy life. The show was an honest lens into a time that is often sanitized of its awful reality. It showed the victims of the terrible people of the story and how they are affected by them. How their lives are changed and made worse when these evil people vie for wealth and power. The themes of Boardwalk are so much deeper and explored far more extensively than in Succession. \n\nOverall it\u2019s just a better show (in my opinion) in just about every regard. The story is more engaging, the performances are more nuanced and thought provoking, the production design is more striking and intricate. And to be clear I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best show ever, just one of many that I think are better than Succession.",

It's supposed to suck and these characters are supposed to be toxic and unlikeable because it's trying to put you into the place of a bunch of miserable people so detached from themselves and everyone around them that they tear each other apart.

But the whole thing about art is people can only approach it from where they're coming from.\n\nI see a lot of very real family realities in Succession and its dynamics, and it also has the room to explore those dynamics in a way that really hit me hard - (Arrested Development and The Royal Tenenbaums are both far Too Comedic and lacking in dramatic punch for me to really connect with the characters. The characters are such jokes with so little grounding I personally find no human element to connect to. I think Succession is very funny and very sad in equal measure) There's a lot of jokes in Succession, but the characters also always feel like very complete whole people to me. But if you are in a deeply toxic family dynamic you will know the exact patterns that make it hard for someone to leave.\n\nWith Roman, or Kendall or Shiv - they have been raised to value certain things. And their ability to connect with other people emotionally or see value outside of the family has been outright hindered by their father. In fact... that's also just a very real phenomenon. If you come from a very abusive, very toxic family you will often find yourself emotionally hindered in ways that makes it hard to connect with other people because of how you have learnt the 'rules of the game' for human social interaction. \"Sensible\" people are not raised in the circumstances Roman, Shiv or Kendall are raised in. It would be impossible for them to have grown into emotionally healthy people in these circumstances.\n\nIt is about toxicity in the family and how this translates to toxicity in the world.",

With all that said I do stand by most of my points about not enjoying it because I hate the characters, and though I think that you don\u2019t need to have someone to root for, I think it\u2019s pretty damn difficult for a show to keep my attention otherwise. In Mad Men for example, you have Peggy and Betty who are objectively good people (at least in the early seasons) to keep you motivated to see how they survive the toxic environment that is 1960s America. After a certain point you end up interested in Don, Roger, Joan, etc also, and want to see where it all goes. In Breaking Bad you start off feeling sympathetic to Walter and his family and even Jesse. Is Succession there is no character there to get you through the first few episodes, you just have to dive in. \n\nAll that said I do enjoy the show and while I hate every character, and especially hate Roman (mostly because of how much the fan base loves him) I still enjoy it a lot and think it\u2019ll go down as one of the greats.",

I felt that way about Barry too, I have seen too many psychopathic make leads, gave up  after Season 2.  I feel like the Succession characters are rendered compelling  through their nuanced performances full stop.  Like there is not a stronger ensemble drama on TV and hasn't been  since the Sopranos ( with Better Call Saul as a runner up).   I also love the writing. I don't actually care that much about the plot. I love is as a big thick 19th century novel, examining compromised characters in moral descent. Plus I came from an emotionally abusive home so I am familiar with some of the dynamics. Sometimes its timing,  like you're not in the mood for a show then years later it's  just the thing..",

Peep Show got dull for me in that way, as did The Thick of It and Breaking Bad. Its a matter of taste who you hate and what you enjoy. \n\nHowever not liking  some  characters is not the same as actively hating all characters in a show. It's unusual for American TV shows to have a whole cast of utterly unlikeable people. Usually American shows with antihero leads offer someone more likeable to root for. Like Jesse in Breaking Bad, Peggy in Mad Men,  Adriana in the Sopranos, Jim and Pam in The Office.  Sometimes this gets very cheesy, for example in the film \" Downfall\"  about Hitler's last days , the directors offered audiences this cute   typist character  to root for.  It was pretty absurd. \n\nI would watch the hell out of a  show about Hitler's  domestic life BTW,  to watch  the decay of morality and sanity.  I can imagine this being directed by Michael Haneke, who explored similar issues in 'The White Ribbon'.  Attaching emotionally to a character on a journey is not the only way to engage with a film for me  ...I dont always need to care about the characters to like a film, I can watch the film for the abstract patterning of the narrative itself, or the ideas being investigated, or the characters  being a metaphor for something else. Like 'Mother!' , 'Inland Empire', or  'The Seventh Continent' ( which contains characters I truly despise BTW.). American film and TV plotting tends to be dominated by ideas of audience identification and emotional closure  from what David Bordwell called   \n\" Classical Hollywood Style\", but for me, there are many  other ways to craft and enjoy films and TV.",

I enjoy the dialogue every episode but it never blows me away or has me howling, it has a sort of safe consistent voice of mild amusement and soft pleasure, but I stuck through season 1 because I was actually getting pretty invested in how the plot was progressing, this growing conflict between the family members, will Kendall succeed in taking over/running the company, how will Gregg continue to navigate this new world, I liked all that, but by the end of season 1 I felt like I had all my answers. The anti-climaxes in Kendal\u2019s plot lines felt so contrived every time, and that they just keep benching him in the conflict over and over is so lame, the second half of season 1 is just spinning tires, it felt like a whole new season that follows after a long season or two arc wraps up and the next season has to pick up the pieces and put them back into motion slowly, but we didn\u2019t even get that actual arc completion it just sputtered out, then Kendall spins out in a way that could be interesting, but he is ultimately brought back into the fold almost exactly where he started with little consequence or growth. My girlfriend continued watching season 2 and I\u2019ve caught a few episodes with her and see it\u2019s much of the same still, the writing is very good, the acting is well done, and I get that it\u2019s the point that these guys are all evil, bland, narcissistic rich people and nothing will ever fundamentally change or whatever, but lots of other stories do this better, they can be funnier, more concise, more evocative, be more satisfying. I\u2019m not going to stick with this show, when I know there are a lot of other pieces of media with more to say that are more deserving of my time.",

I can see how it looks like I\u2019m complaining, but I\u2019m really just struggling to see why people stuck it out for these characters in the first place. Those few episodes I watched went out of their way to make these people clearly shitty and unlikable so I just don\u2019t get why people cared about the show initially. That was really what I was trying to get at but I can see how it seems more whiney.",

                "comment_text": "Black Sails is my #1 recommendation but with the caveat that you have to watch a Spartacus type show for almost an entire season for it to bloom into what it actually is. The first season very heavily leans on the tried and true classic \u201cget \u2018em with titties and blood\u201d that many shows relied on around the time when it came out. That being said, it\u2019s still a very enjoyable watch during those episodes, but it just feels a little like discount Pirates of the Caribbean but with sex and more blood. However, it evolves into one of the best series I\u2019ve ever watched, with some of the best character arcs you\u2019ll see in a 4 season series. The production quality is very high except for a few shots of the ships sailing in the first season. The acting is phenomenal as well. Oh, and it\u2019s a prequel to Treasure Island, and if you\u2019re a fan of the book or any of the movies then you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised at how well it delivers.\n\nI prefer Hill House over Bly Manor but they\u2019re both done very well. Few to no jump scares with a heavy focus on story and atmosphere. Midnight Mass is made by the same person but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as much of a horror show as the other two but still very good. They\u2019re all \u2018binge it in a couple of nights\u2019 type of shows. \n\nI\u2019m not going to do a review of every show here but they\u2019re all very good with solid endings which, for me, is pretty much the most important part, aside from just being a good story obviously.",

She\u2019s also not featured very much early on which is when I think it\u2019s most important to give viewers an emotional hook. I personally love Breaking Bad and Mad Men but can\u2019t stand the Sopranos because of how insufferable all the characters are. Tony is always praised as being this super complex character but I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s more complex than any protagonist of your favorite story. For me, The Americans\u2019 dual protagonists Elizabeth and Philip are both so much more interesting to watch than Tony ever was. And ultimately it\u2019s about how much enjoyment you derive from the story. For me, Succession is fun to watch and I like it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as good as people say it is.

The plights like wanting to see their dad but Marsha (I think?) won\u2019t let them just does nothing for me because I don\u2019t care whether they do or not. The twist that the company is in massive debt was fun and I get that the band aid they fixed it with will definitely bite them later, but I just feel neutral about it. I\u2019m not excited to see them get fucked over nor am I hoping they figure it out before it gets too bad. This is the big part that confuses me. Why do I care what happens to them? I want to see bad things happen to Roman, Logan, and Shivs fianc\u00e9e but not so bad that I\u2019m waiting excitedly to see how they get fucked in the next episode. I totally get that it isn\u2019t for me, but my problem is I don\u2019t know why. I have a very broad range of tastes, many of which are similar to this series but none have this issue (an issue I\u2019m very aware is only an issue for me). For example, films like Nightcrawler, Taxi Driver and The Social Network all feature bad people as their protagonists and show you that pretty early on. What keeps you on the edge of your seat is the extremely compelling plot and character depth (something that I\u2019m very aware I haven\u2019t been able to see yet, and that\u2019s not my point) and you squirm as you watch these characters make decisions that harm others and always end badly (Nightcrawler being the exception). I\u2019m ranting again, and I apologize because I can tell this bothers all of you fans, I just thought you would be the people to talk to about it.",

I thought the show was great and the initial hype was well deserved and then it seemed the hype was just way too much. I am very happy for the cast and writer for their new found success.\n\nIt has been a while since I watched Queen's Gambit, but I thought it was pretty good. I watched it as everyone I spoke to kept raving about it and I am a novice chess player. I would not put it in my Top 10 shows however.\n\nI will check out Pawn Sacrifice, so thanks for the indirect recommendation :)",

Imo the most underrated things about the hp series was the kids just having fun shenanigans during classes/the school year. None of the save the world stuff needs to be in it, just life as a witch/wizard is all it needs. Animate it if you want to give you more freedom with set design and story planning. It would likely be quite popular if done right.",

On top of that, the platform even manages to catapult well loved shows to mainstream appeal like Community and Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nBut focusing on the originals, retrospectively many really aren't that great. Some of that's up to opinion of course. But for me personally, I wasn't a big fan of Queen's Gambit for a variety of reasons, Riverdale was not my cup of tea. Black Mirror had some standout episodes though many weren't. And I honestly couldn't even understand why 13 Reasons Why got any love at all. Have not watched Squid Game but thinking about watching that show lead me to this question.\n\nI'm sure your views are different and I'm sure you might love shows I don't. But I'm curious, what did you watch that lived up to or exceeded what you heard of it?\n\nFor me the best examples are the Escobar seasons of Narcos and the first season of Daredevil. They didn't keep it up later in their runs. But damn, did they live up to the promises I heard of them.",

So it might depends on your demographic and the demographic you surround yourself with. \n\nAlso, The Queens Gambit came out during the hight of the pandemic. Most people were probably still home and just blazing through Netflix.

I\u2019m pretty sure that in a normal year the hype for this would have built on the back of a solid outing for the show at the Golden Globes. They absolutely adore shows like Maid and leads like Margaret Qualley.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised by the Maid numbers. It has stuck around Netflix\u2019s top ten charts for most of its run and performed very solidly in all markets. I think the absolute monster hit that was Squid Game just left Maid stick in the number 2 slot for most of its run. No shame in that given the popularity of Squid Game! \n\nI\u2019m also expecting good numbers for Sex Education s3. It has been solid in the top 10 lists as well. \n\nBe interesting to see the numbers for The Chestnut Man. It has dropped in the shadow of Squid Game, Maid, and Sex Education but looks to have performed solidly for an international title.",

It's also way easier to make TikTok videos and YouTube content from Squid Game because of its premise and costume design. It's an easy enough calling card to replicate (a green track suit and a pink jumpsuit is hella easy to recreate for a lot of folks) so much so that it's going to be an iconic Halloween costume this year.\n\nI get it, SG is just so much easier to recognize based on its aesthetic, it's easy to fall into a rabbit hole of content based on it. I liked the show a lot, probably my favorite new show of the year, not gonna lie. However, I think Midnight Mass was pretty darn good too, and even though some of those monologues were a bit irritating, it didn't diminish the show's true brilliance on its themes of religion and personal guilt.\n\nI've yet to watch Maid, but I hear that's also very good, and I've started Foundation, but that one I'm not so sure about (I just don't know how they can adapt the books without adding a lot of fluff to pad the story).  \n\nWe are in a great time to have a plethora of great shows, but it also means that some shows are just going to get left behind as other shows sweep up the publicity.",

This is what happened for both supporting actor wins for Ted Lasso.\n\nHowever, the thing I think is really valuable from the Emmys is that it can help the television genres evolve when they back certain shows. There was an incredible 5 year stretch in the 2000s where Arrested Development, The Office, and 30 Rock won comedy series. Before that, everything was laugh tracks and broad humor. None of them were the first to do what they did, but the industry recognition for them really helped to expand the genre. Same with Lost and GOT on the drama side.\n\nWhether or not this year means anything for the future of the industry (and I'd be inclined to say it was a pretty weak year for obvious reasons) is still up in the air. Awards shows hold weight in what kind of projects get sent down the pipeline though so even if the whole event isn't really your taste, I still think it's important to keep track of what is winning and how people generally react to it. It says a lot about where TV will be a decade down the road",

The entire show is essentially a testament to how great America is, whereas Mare of Easttown had a script filled with charming social discussion, dealing with smaller and more personal subject matter in a more effective and detailed way.\n\nRegardless of the money they threw at it in terms of general aesthetics/ realising each time period, I could not like The Queen\u2019s Gambit because it did not have much substance as a story with context. It felt glossy and meaningless, and I felt there was something off about Taylor-Joy\u2019s portrayal of Beth Harmon. She did not seem like a believable character to me: it could have been the script coupled with delivery. \n\nAltogether, I am disappointed with the majority of the picks at the Emmys, but know not to expect quality selections in the future.",

Beth Harmon is an American lady, unrealistically untouched by gender issues and the time (many female chess players have highlighted this), who strives to beat the greatest Russian chess players and succeeds. This is doubtless an American triumph, and was indeed when the male chess player Harmon was based on beat Borgov on his trip to Russia. There are also a few chess facts deliberately misrepresented to propel Beth as a protagonist and put other real chess players down, one which I mentioned earlier. \n\nPerhaps I\u2019m crazy, but The Queens Gambit feels too shallow to me, and doubtless has more than a few flaws.",

Other excellent versions of this stoic, sweater-wearing policewoman appear in The Bridge and it\u2019s American remake, and the excellent Italian series, Thou Shalt Not Kill. Mare also borrowed from Happy Valley. There are others too numerous to mention. At least Thou Shalt Not Kill acknowledged the homage to Nordic Noir and The Killing. It\u2019s a good genre, and all the actresses are great, but that knocked down points for Mare. Winslet gave a very similar performance in Ammonite. She\u2019s been so dour lately. Queen\u2019s Gambit was truly unique and Taylor-Joy gave a star-making performance.",

They mentioned plenty of times now one of the reasons Russians were so good at chess was that the banded together and cooperated, even to the point of cheating. The show subverted the traditional image of chess as something highly individualistic to something that stlll depends a lot on social support. Support was one of the major themes. Beth grew up in an orphanage, yet she was luckier than most, every step of the way she had people who raised her up, stood behind her and supported her. But she was her own worst enemy, in the end it wasn't external obstacles like sexism she had to overcome, but her own demons. She wasn't a strong person at first, like you said, she wasn't used to accepting defeat and didn't know how to handle it. She had to learn how to admit that she needed help and support, both in real life and chess, and in the end that's what helped her win against the best of the best.\n\nI'm a woman but I really loved this show for not going in for the typical \"female empowerment\" fantasy, those stories are a dome a dozen these days. I'm glad they allowed Beth to be a real and complex character, defined by more than just her sex.",

Even though per episode the quality is higher in many shorter shows, the longer running shows have a place in my heart that shorter shows never will.\n\nI agree with what other people have said, but I think it's more than just them being on for a longer part of your life.\n\nLong-running tv shows with 22+ episode seasons have filler episodes that aren't great or don't advance the plot,  and generally the storytelling is not as tight as a short modern show. Because of that, we spend time with the characters in these meandering episodes. We get to know them intimately, like a relationship that develops over years.  Because every scene isn't extremely important to the overall story we experience a lot more with them and get attached.  I actually think the longer format with room (and need) for filler content or serial content is part of what makes these long-running shows so cherished.   These shows also have more time/room for big character arcs and themes and giving you the feels.\n\nI binge-watched all 7 seasons of Buffy in 1 summer,  and that show and the characters are special to me in a way that a shorter show could never touch.   Even though not every episode is phenomenal, and even though I watched the whole thing in 3 months.\n\nWhen Pam says goodbye to Michael at the airport in The Office, you feel that in a way you never could with a character from Queen's Gambit or Mare of Easttown (both amazing).\n\nThe moment Buffy realizes the meaning of \"death is your gift\" in Season 5 and \\[you know what, no spoilers\\] is SO emotional because we've been pondering this phrase along with her for quite a while and understand everything that her choice means.\n\nI have been missing these types of shows lately and feel like modern tv, although super high quality, is lacking some of the beauty of the older shows.",

        "text": "Spoiler due to some of my descriptions and I'm a complete amateur in describing my quick thoughts, but here are my reviews for many shows over the past few years. \n\n**Game of Thrones, 9/10**: Amazing for a long time and fizzles out in season 8 due to directing that still get's shit on to this day. some rewatchability and can go hours into reading about plot and details\n\n**Sex Education, 9/10:** Laugh your ass off funny and tackles some modern social issues too, good combination of coming of age + British humor\n\n**Big Mouth, 10/10:** Probably the funniest show on TV and gets increasingly ridiculous. Great cast and comedic taste, the humor ranges between witty and crude but also brings in wholesome elements. Also tackles some modern social issues and is just all around relatable.\n\n**The Last Kingdom, 8/10:** Gives decent historical context and is a great medieval series, some of the episodes can kind of drag but if you're looking for a good action series with good character development and gruesome fights, this is your pick. It's no GOT but is a nice spin.\n\n**Last Chance U Basketball, 7/10:** Slow to start but god I was on the verge of tears a few times rooting for east LA, producers did a great job of connecting the people and making it feel like you were cheering on your own local team. However none of the people really 'popped off' for me after their time with East LA, seemed kind of over dramatized but that's show biz \n\n**Schitt's Creek, 8/10:** Not always laugh out loud funny. but stick with the characters as they grow and the investment pays off, becoming increasingly funnier and incredibly heartwarming\n\n**Kim's Convenience, 7/10:** Started watching this being newer to Canadian TV and it is a great feel-good yet funny series that touches on immigrants balancing cultures, but carried some just plain unrealistic/run-of-the-mill plot lines. Loveable characters is a big plus\n\n**You, 6/10:** Sucks you in pretty deep and was a fun but short ride for me, the formula just seems to be repeated too often, couldn't get through season two. Still worth a watch though for the thrills.\n\n**The Walking Dead, 7/10:** Great show in all honesty and is a pioneer in apocalypse TV for me, but there are very, very slow parts and I just got bored of it and quit I think sometime in season 4? It would probably be worth to do a rewatch and continue from there\n\n**Too Hot To Handle, 7/10:** Just all around trash reality TV with hilarious drama and girls that are easy to look at, enjoyable \n\n**The Queen's Gambit, 9/10:** All the raving about this limited series is justified, it's just really well put together and is an interesting story plus great lead acting. Also cool that it basically surged chess into pop culture popularity\n\n**Death to 2020, 8/10:** Funny, witty and hits the nail on the head with many points. Good mockumentary\n\n**Dota: Dragon's Blood, 8/10**: Really cool to see some of the Dota heroes put into lore and this one was a real cliffhanger, one of those series where you are like 'fuck I gotta wait x amount of time' to watch again\n\n**F is for Family, 8/10:** Pretty cynical and for dry humor it doesn't get much better, Bill Burr basically makes his childhood into a cartoon with consistent laugh out loud moments\n\n**Feel Good, 6/10:** Very progressive and interesting plot but not quite as funny as I think it was targeted to be, still a decent watch\n\n**Gentified, 7/10:** Takes a little bit to get into but it's good when off and running, shows a unique perspective into the value of a community that is trying to resist gentrification\n\n**Cursed, 3/10:** Maybe too premature of a review but I couldn't get past 2 episodes, this is just a painfully average if not terribly written fantasy trying to leverage the girl from 13 Reasons Why\n\n**13 Reasons Why, 6/10:** The first season is really good and is a valuable watch but can be a little heavy (as it should be given subject matter), but ended up kind of being, ironically, a negative influence in the real world. Couldn't get through season 2 and I don't know why they continued it, would've been one of those where it was right to leave it after one season\n\n**Southern Survival: Outdoor Gear Tested, 4/10:** Kind of funny but I couldn't even finish - this show was Netflix grabbing at the south and Middle America with a hic version of Mythbusters\n\n**Lovesick, 7/10:** British comedy is always quality, I liked the idea of the show. Endgame was fairly obvious but fun to watch the how, nonetheless\n\n**Love, 5/10:** I just couldn't find this that funny or interesting, seemed like an average alternative/indie show to watch. Maybe will have to give it another chance in the future\n\n**Home Game, 7/10:** There is some cool shit in this world that we have 0 perspective on, anthology documentaries like this are always a treat\n\n**Never Have I Ever, 8/10:** Another coming of age series that checks all the boxes while adding a new spin to the typical patterns you will see, and narrated by John McEnroe is a funny touch\n\n**White Gold, 8/10:** British comedy, edgy, and actors from The Inbetweeners\n\n**The Inbetweeners, 9/10:** This is quintessential British wanker dry/crass/crude humor sitcom that is just plain hilarious. This show would not make it to the air today for some of it's non-PC lines and is a comedic gem\n\n**Sick Note, 6/10:** It's got Ron from Harry Potter and is a decent British romcom watch\n\n**7 Days Out, 6/10:** Anthology doc series on different big events around the world, interesting filler tv if you have nothing you're glued to. The League of Legends episode is what I came for\n\n**Selling Sunset, 7/10:** Juicy reality TV with a unique approach, get to see cool real estate in the midst of entertaining characters/drama. Davina bad, Crishell good, Christine ridiculous, Oppenheim brothers are basically simping for their employees and is funny to watch \n\n**Community, 8/10:** Didn't finish because the show fizzled out into the 4th season for me but in its prime it was crazy good, witty comedy. Loved the characters and can see why it's a reddit favorite\n\n**Breaking Bad, 10/10:** This is on the all-time list for so many for good reason, incredibly well done and epic series. character development, crazy twists and really cleverly written lines \n\n**Normal People, 8/10:** Pretty gripping romance that keeps things interesting and real, great acting and didn't know about Irish TV before this \n\n**Master of None, 9/10:** Aziz Ansari's humor goes so much further in a TV show than in his standup. Aside form the great plotline and characters, the value with this show is it's take on the modern dating scene and relatability to young adult life in 20s and early 30s \n\n**Black Mirror, 8/10:** Good for thrills or big woah moments. As many have said it really is The Twilight Zone of our generation and as an anthology series has episodes that are mind-blowing, dark, disturbing, and warning of the double edged sword that is advanced technology. Obviously just a show but a lot of the episodes just feel like they could be real in the not so distant future\n\n**The End of the F\\*\\*\\*cking World, 8/10:** Really unique dark British dramedy, saw a review that labeled it as a modern day Bonnie and Clyde type story and that's very accurate. Enjoyable watch\n\n**Indian Matchmaking, 7/10:** Some cool insight into how different Indian families are matchmaking through a central broker. You end up loving some of the characters and hating the others, entertaining reality TV that's not just typical trash filler\n\n**Parks & Recreation, 8/10:** Wholesome, hilarious with great cast and characters, everyone's heard of it and I really enjoyed it \n\n**The Office, 7/10:** Maybe I just really need to rewatch but I didn't think it was as incredibly funny and gem status as most people treasure it to be. Will definitely rewatch to gage again, but was enjoyable and pretty funny nonetheless\n\n**Mad Men, 10/10:** This show has some of the best writing, acting and character development there is and is (supposedly) very accurate historically. Super interesting plotline and approach to covering the 60s and early 70s from a white collar perspective. I've watched twice through and will likely do another round within the next few years\n\n**Westworld, 9/10:** I give it a 9 because of the first season, what a beautifully thought out and put together show that is one of the coolest concepts on TV. It is a big mindfuck and had me searching through theories on reddit and peoples' analyses just to understand what's going on, which is also its downfall for me as the show goes on. I will continue to watch it because I'm a big fan but everything is so convoluted that I need constant recaps. Great TV though and I'm invested\n\n**Sharp Objects, 8/10:** Pretty damn good slow burn with a big drop at the end, you might be able to see it coming but is great thriller/creepy/mystery entertainment\n\n**Succession, 9/10:** Great characters & family dynamic, if it's at all accurate of mega rich corporate families then good on the producers but god it's very entertaining with heavy humor and drama mixed in\n\n**Boardwalk Empire, 8/10:** It's Steve Buscemi as a booming 20s mob lord and he actually does a damn good job. It's pretty entertaining but been so long that I can't remember a lot of it\n\n**Entourage, 8/10:** Not as much of a classic that a lot of people claim it to be, but is a great watch and fun to vicariously live through the lives of these characters being full ballers\n\n**Camping, 5/10:** Got some laughs but had a meh vibe to it, nothing that separates it from the crowd\n\n**The Handmaid's Tale, 8/10:** Very gripping drama/thriller that does the book justice with great acting from Elizabeth Moss (got her start in Mad Men) and has some intense highs, but can drag a little slowly sometimes. Will continue to watch as my gf swears by it as her favorite show \n\n**Chernobyl, 10/10:** Historically accurate and incredibly well done, it really captures the magnitude of the explosion, its impact, and highlights the Russian government's political corruption and failures that persist today. Really chilling, amazing tv\n\n**Industry, 7/10:** A cool, high tempo drama about young professionals trying to get ahead at a British investment bank, just a little too much sex as filler for which the time could've been used better\n\n**Naruto & Naruto Shippuden, 9/10:** It's must watch and is basically the king of anime. be sure to google the fillers to skip (unless you really into it) for the main plot \n\n**Malcolm in the Middle, 9/10:** Classic tv for me that I grew up watching and still laugh at the relatability of growing up as 3 brothers in a middle-class home\n\n**Catch-22, 7/10:** Has its funny moments but also its absurd ones, pretty good watch and satires war hard. A good homage to the book but not as in depth\n\n**Bob's Burgers, 8/10:** The most wholesome yet funny and loveable characters there are in adult animation. Watch this when you need some feel good moments\n\n**Dave, 8/10:** Hilarious, edgy and honestly impressive TV from Lil Dicky, I don't think people expected the show to actually be as good as it is\n\n**Little America, 9/10:** True stories anthology series of immigrants and their self establishment in America, it's filled with heartbreak, hope, laughs and triumphs that are of great quality. Maybe I was just in my feels but was in tears during several of these episodes\n\n**Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet, 9/10:** Loved the idea for this as a gamer and thankful for its success, taking a gaming company and putting it through hilarious challenges with hilarious solutions and characters, all with a touch of wholesome to it\n\n**Ted Lasso, 9/10:** Jason Sudeikis hit the ball out of the park on this one which is another great premise for a tv show, with good characters, great humor and more of that wholesomeness that is being seen on Apple TV+ shows. While a Premier League team (or any professional soccer team) taking an American football coach would literally never happen, it's super entertaining\n\n**The League, 8/10:** Hilarious, you don't have to know too much about football to enjoy this one (although now the references are pretty outdated), is great for when you want fart-heavy humor and is somewhat of a cult classic for many fantasy football fanatics",

It's been pretty interesting to watch the innovation in film production, especially from fantasy or sci-fi that does a lot of green screen ing and all that fancy jazz versus a drama on location.\n\nfor example, succession was beautiful to watch even if you hate the people which you should. But can't wait for more of that\n\nThanks for your kind and informed comment. I get to update my info.",

However I suspect the problem is that I still connote him with comedy so I viewed his performance as from a sketch comedy fake movie, so I would give him a pass if others seem to like him. But the supporting cast is even worse.  \nAnd what really brings the series down is the writing. They got a good thing going, when Assane pulls his tricks, but everything else is poorly done.",

Without a wig, glasses or anything to hide his face from the many cameras and recordings of the event (But he created a fake wikipedia page! -_-). And there's one person who knew him as a teen in the audience.\n- And in the end, they can't resist filming him exiting the Louvre with the prize, a very shiny, very noticeable necklace, in his hand.",

You either spend it watching 5 videos on tiktok or 5 minutes of Netflix. Either way you now have 5 less minutes to watch. \n\nSecond, I assume that 2 minute number is not arbitrary. Data nerds at Netflix have likely found if a viewer sticks around for two minutes, they are going to stick around for 2 more. And so on. \n\nSo a two minute view is as good as 15 minutes or completion. \n\nWhy talk about two minute views? Completions, next episodes, hours watched, that stuff is all  proprietor AND that is the way other video platforms talk about views. Im sure they also look at all the other potential metric. But 2 minute views have the strongest  correlation with a videos success.",

And the show plays a number of times on the fact that he's black when Assane teases people that underestimate him because of it. Ask any fellow parisian, cops will quickly pick him up intra-muros, even if he was hiding in Barb\u00e8s.  \nI mean, even that journalist found him without the help of any cctv to track his movements.  \nTo be fair, disguises would always be a problem for films in today's surveillance age, even the Mission Impossible movies have to use incredibly gimmicky gadgets to pull off those stunts nowadays.  \nHe's shown to have had a long career by now, you would think the cops would have had an open case about the tall skinny black guy with a distinctive face that seems to have a similar MO in stealing from profiteers of blood money.  \n\nHowever, Assane's character being an \"outsider\" is important to the story, first for his immigrant experience as his father was an easy scapegoat for his employer's fraud, but also as Lupin inspired him on how to fit in. But they should not have coupled that with his height and distinctive face, he sticks out too much. An actor of average stature would have been needed, and I think had they written the character as being moroccan, algerian or tunisian, the story would have kept all of its potency but allowed Assane an even wider range of disguises within french society for him to evade attention.\n\n\nBTW, him giving a diamond from the stolen necklace to the wife of the dying prisoner that kept his father's clues, as if she wouldn't get arrested the moment she tried to sell it.

You know that right?\n\nAnd of course I know what audio description is, but you know some foreign shows don't have audio description available for blind people, RIGHT?

I tried it and I spent most of the time reading rather than taking in what is supposed to be a visual medium. It did give me the full cultural experience, as you said, but I also missed out on a lot of the visual details and intricacies (cinematography, acting, vfx and action shots,..).

The biggest being that these people were cast for their parts in the show. That means the dialog, mannerisms, tone, etc. had a part in the creators wanting them in their roles. I\u2019m not trying to downplay dubs and the effort that goes into them, but they were not the original that the production was built around.  \n  \nSo it was quite enjoyable to watch in German to see the original and how it all came together. The actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. Even though you can\u2019t understand the words (but you are reading the subtitles), the tone in their voice and their mannerisms can really reflect how they are feeling and they did fantastic. It really helped set the mood of the show. Germany is coincidentally the only country I\u2019ve visited outside of Canada/US.  \n  \nI enjoy foreign media. Recently I watched a few of Mads Danish films with Adam\u2019s Apple, The Green Butchers and Another Round. Last year I had watched Ad Vitam and then Transfers in French after taking interest after watching Raw. I wish it was easier to find!",

I don\u2019t think Queen\u2019s Gambit knows that.\n\nWhile watching, like the show was off on its depiction of misogyny (and bigotry in general). Then I had to decide if that really affected whether I would enjoy the show. \n\nOne of the best depictions of period misogyny I recall watching was Mad Men. \n\nBut there are plenty of sloppy or ham-fisted period depictions of it, where a male character simply refuses to accept a character throughout an entire show, and creates a barrier that must be overcome as a moment of triumph. It\u2019s very expected. It\u2019s a trope. So when the gender barrier was so quickly overcome in Queens Gambit, it felt off. \n\nI realized it wasn\u2019t that kind of show. But does that make it problematic?\n\nChess is a world that is mysterious to most people. Is it possible that this story would have happened, that she would have succeeded due to sheer exceptionalism? Do chess players really value talent more than innate prejudice? Does that really ever happen ever? Can it have happened in the 60s? I honestly don\u2019t know, but I went with it. \n\nBeth is treated like this strange oddity, a unicorn that people heard about in legend and lore but had to see in person to believe she existed. \n\nThe thing is, you can\u2019t really cheat at chess. It\u2019s a binary game. You either win or lose (or draw, rarely). You either can beat someone or not. You can win through luck \u2014 usually an excellent player is having an off day, or you accidentally choose a brilliant move. \n\nThere is a theme in the series that people think maybe she\u2019s just gotten lucky, until they watch her play and become true believers. \n\nBeing a ranked chess player doesn\u2019t make you better, but it does make you good, objectively. \n\nThe article argues that her beauty distracts from all the sexism that she should have experienced? Maybe?\n\nThe article also says that her beauty portrays chess as intimate and sexy. So? For many people, chess *is* intimate and sexy. \n\nI guess the criticism may be that the show makes the past feel more progressive than it really was. And that can be dangerous, to idealize a past that never really existed. \n\nIt might also be dangerous to show that exceptionalism will save you from prejudice, because it often doesn\u2019t. \n\nBut it\u2019s not that kind of show. It\u2019s not a show about sexism, and maybe that\u2019s okay. Not every period show featuring a female lead has to be about sexism, does it?",

The casual misogyny of the times working synergistically with their their geek egos.   \n\nWomen being under represented both as club members and as well ranked players lends to a confirmation bias.  \"Look how few women there are in chess. See? Women can't play chess well.\"   \n\nPeople who compete in intellectual activities can be much worse than any jock when it comes to ego, dickish behaviour, and being proud of the size of their geek peen.   \nAdd in that she has no club or tournament experience and is ignorant about rankings &c... They would have been condescending even if it was Burt instead of Beth.     \n\nBut she won. Against someone they *knew* they couldn't beat.  Someone who, even with their egos they readily admit completely outclasses them.       \n\nAnd then they would have studied her game.   Probably, they would have reviewed all of her games at the tournament wanting to see how this total noob beat everyone.        \n\nIt's not that unrealistic that they might have done a 180 with their attitudes.   \nIf you want to play better chess, you need to lose to better players first.  And they knew she was better.   \n\nSeriously, if you're obsessed with chess you'll willing play and lose to people you can't stand if you think it's educational enough.    \nPeople will pay to play against you if you're highly enough ranked.  \n\"You're paying for the match, not instruction. Understood?\"  \n\"Shut up and take my money!\"   \n\n\nBeth was, pretty cool as these things go, and easy on the eyes.   \nSo you'd have to be more than a casual misogynist to dislike her in your club or tournament. You'd have to go pro.   \n\n\nBy the time she'd won a couple tournaments, (the match annotations, or at least the highlight matches are published) everyone who followed them would have studied at least the tournament winning game.     \n\nStrangers may have been casual chauvinist dicks until they realised who she was, and some still wouldn't have been happy to lose to a girl, but once she'd earned some ~~street~~ tournament cred, that probably toned down a fair bit.",

This could be something about the mainstream nature of cinema maybe but over the last couple of years TV has become much more interesting, deeper, better written, professionally produced and generally just a bigger budget with better people involved. For me this all came together with Watchmen this year. I really liked the movie but this took it to the next level. I spent 4-6 episodes scratching my head and sniffing around online, trying to figure out what was going on, then the answers started to arrive thick and fast. The last 2 episodes were probably the best TV I have ever seen. \n\n   Other series I have enjoyed - True Detective, The Boys, Succession, The Mandalorian, The Expanse, Chernobyl, Ozark, Narcos,  The Queen's Gambit, GOT, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Mindhunters...... the list goes on. During the UK's lockdown I finally managed to watch The Wire and Mr. Robot (which I am still digesting and will do again).  I remember when The Sopranos launched, it was when American TV became great but there was just not enough of it. Now, as you can see, I can't get enough. There is no doubt streaming has come on in recent times and the providers aren't that expensive. I hope this trend continues as I for one am happy to be watching from the comfort of my armchair.",

        "text": "Like a lot of people, I binged the Queen's Gambit recently and really enjoyed it. It's beautifully shot--maybe the most visually compelling 60's period drama since Mad Men--and the performances are excellent, particularly Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead role of Beth Harmon.\n\nBut what I most enjoyed about it is how it mirrors the structure of a sports anime, a genre that I don't see referenced a lot in western media.\n\nIt begins with the protagonist--who has brightly colored hair and cartoonishly large eyes--as a young child with a traumatic background that makes them something of a societal outcast. The protagonist enters a new educational environment where they don't really fit in with most of the other kids, but have one friend who looks out for them. Eventually they meet a gruff, eccentric mentor figure who introduces them to a new game that they immediately fall in love with and display tremendous raw talent for, but know nothing about so that as they learn the basics the audience will also learn the rules of the game and subculture around it. The protagonist becomes obsessed with the game and starts training constantly.\n\nEventually, the protagonist enters small local tournaments, where they are truly introduced to the subculture around the game (which is almost an entire world unto itself where everyone treat the game as the most important thing in life) and meet more experienced competitors who initially look down on them as a rookie, and who all have various defining quirks like being twins, a weird tic like constantly chewing, etc. The protagonist easily beats them, thus showing the audience how talented they are. However, its clear that this is just the lowest level of play, and bigger tournaments have much more formidable competition.\n\nThe protagonist eventually goes to bigger tournaments, where they will meet more formidable rivals--who all have their own quirks too, like dressing like a cowboy or something. They beat one or two of those rivals, but its much harder, and eventually they finally lose in a big match, which initially devastates them but then serves as motivation to train even harder. They also keep hearing about the greatest player in the world, a formidable figure who isn't initially shown but who is considered almost unbeatable.\n\nEventually the protagonist plays the world's greatest player and loses. This forces them to train with their old rivals who have now all become their friends, and add new dimensions to their playstyle, preparing them for a critical rematch for the title of the best.\n\nThe nice thing about the Queen's Gambit is how it hits all these familiar notes for fans of the sports anime genre, but in a way that feels genuinely well executed. If you're a fan of the genre, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.",

You could draw this in a manga and tell the story as is and you'd not notice many big difference in the story structure from contemporary battle shounen lol.",

It's basically YA fiction made into a show, I mean.. okay, compare it to a list of [common YA tropes](https://studybreaks.com/culture/reads/ya-book-tropes-need-to-evolve/):\n\n* Protagonist as outsider.  More often than not, a YA protagonist is singled out as a misfit or an outcast in their society. - Big yes, Beth is portrayed as not fitting in with the typical girls her age\n\n* \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d protagonist.  This trope, of course, comes straight out of J.K. Rowling\u2019s playbook. - Again yes, Beth is the only one who can defeat the Russians\n\n* The protagonist is typically a teenager. - Yes\n\n* White, able-bodied, straight protagonists. - Yes\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce a character solely as a love interest. Designing a character to act solely as a love interest is to me, a fiction writer in training, a total disservice to that character. - IMO yes but debatable\n\n* Love triangles are beyond overdone. - No, thankfully\n\n* Starting a rebellion and overthrowing the government. - No\n\n* Dead, absent or estranged relatives of the protagonist. - Yes\n\nSo it meets like 5 or 6 of the 8 tropes laid out, which I guess isn't a condemnation in itself, but whatever, its still a bit cliche.\n\nThe show has alot about her alcohol and drug addiction, but none of it seemed to matter all that much in the end.  She lost one game due to being hungover and upset some people, and that's about it.  Seemed to take up alot of screen time when it didn't really matter all that much.  And all her friends seem to circle around her in the end for the extremely cliche wish fulfillment ending.\n\nI guess it showed a bit about how talent requires a bit of work, but only loosely, and otherwise didn't seem to have anything to say.  I just don't.. get it?  It has pretty set pieces but the plot feels so hollow and cliche, and falls into many tropes (though people seem happy it does the tropes \"right\", idk).  I liked it but im confused as to the overwhelmingly positive reaction.",

That isn't a good way to determine if a story is shallow or not, because then every story would be shallow. For example, this one is a bildungsroman, too. Just like Harry Potter.\n \nAs a female in the competitive chess world who has also struggled with drug addiction and psychosis, I especially found the feminist commentary really accurate and inspiring. I actually think this is the most important show I've seen in awhile because it has changed the perspectives of so many people. The chess world has permanently been changed and I'm so thankful for that. I think that's why most people find it so good: it changed the way people look at chess forever. And that's the goal of any piece of art: to move people. To change them in some way, by showing them a new way to look at something familiar.\n\nI'm literally obsessed with the social aspect of chess. Ive been telling people for years that it's such a good way to build genuine connection with people. Since this show, and mainly the characters in the show, SO many people have contacted me within the past few weeks about learning how to play, asking me for help, and showing me pics of them playing. It's a very legitimate way to build strong social bonds. \n\nPersonally, I can't even remember seeing any show that's brought people together, like this one. \nAnd it's fine if you don't personally get it or care for it, everyone has their own opinion... but that isn't a good justification for calling something shallow or cliche, just because you don't get it.",

More often than not, a YA protagonist is singled out as a misfit or an outcast in their society. - Big yes, Beth is portrayed as not fitting in with the typical girls her age\n\nShe's not singled out as a misfit, she's intentionally trying to separate herself from everyone else, hence why all of her relationships fall apart.\n\n >\u201cThe Chosen One\u201d protagonist. This trope, of course, comes straight out of J.K. Rowling\u2019s playbook. - Again yes, Beth is the only one who can defeat the Russians\n\nBeth is the only one who can defeat the Russians because she's the only one who is good enough at chess to do so... It was also laid out quite clearly that she was very capable of losing to the Russians due to get addiction and mental issues. Also, Harry isn't necessarily the chosen one,  Neville is equally so. And Harry is not a \"chosen one\" by virtue of some external godly force; he was chosen by Voldemort himself unintentionally. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that Voldemort made happen out of fear of it happening. If he hadn't killed Lilly, her sacrificial protection spell wouldn't have split Voldemort's soul, putting it into harry and making him a horcrux that can sense other horcruxes, and it wouldn't have made Voldy vulnerable. In summary, you're off base about Harry Potter - he isn't a typical chosen one, it's not wishy washy, there's logic to it.\n\n >The protagonist is typically a teenager. - Yes\n\nReal world chess champ Magnus Carlsen was in his teens when he became world champ. Beth was in her early 20's.\n\n >White, able-bodied, straight protagonists. - Yes\n\nShockingly, most of America contains white, able-bodied, straight people... Truly surprising, I know.\n\n>Don\u2019t introduce a character solely as a love interest. Designing a character to act solely as a love interest is to me, a fiction writer in training, a total disservice to that character. - IMO yes but debatable\n\nThe point of introducing that character was to subvert expectations - YOU expected that love interest character to result in something, the story subverted your expectations and showed that not all relationships result in something and now you're calling it a trope? Or bad writing? Seems a bit strange to me.\n\nI think you're really stretching this whole trope argument. Sure, it is has some tropes... But so do the best stories in film history.",

I think it\u2019s heavily implied Beth is bisexual as is Benny and his inner group of chess friends. She definitely has feelings towards Cleo and even shows some towards the first girl she beat in episode 2. I think her relationship with Jolene is definitely platonic though. I agree many characters fit the trope, but the core protagonists aside from Harry, mrs. Heller and Townes have a sexual fluidity that made it more relatable for the target audience of the series. I also see it as a similar connection to the world of art, theatre, etc. Where sexuallity is less black and white and much more come and go. None of this is explicitly stated, but I think within the chess group it\u2019s implied everyone is sleeping with everyone.",

Clearly she experiences some obstacles (stepmother's death, losing a few games), but it's rather unclear how she overcomes them except by sheer willpower and drugs. The part I liked the best was the scene where Beth wakes up after partying with her college friends, and there's a montage where she's enjoying her sense of adult freedom. That's a much subtler scene than most of the series was able to depict.\n\nI was generally impressed by the production values and acting, as well as Taylor-Joy's ability to subtly express Beth's development from teenager to an adult. She plays Beth a little differently when she's supposed by 15 than when she's supposed to be 20. Other than that, it's a well-made show that leans a bit too heavily on standard Hollywood tropes.",

I'd liken it to enjoying music in some sense, the anticipation and satisfaction of each move leading to the next.",

Took all the fun out of it for me.

I became fully enamored.\n\n\nYou don't need to be smart to play chess, the guys in jail were great players, but we're also all fucking idiots. The more time you put in the better you'll get.

Just playing it and doing the best you can to your ability is enjoyable and gets you in shape.

Watched the first four (?) episodes with my SO last night and I have total disinterest in finishing it. It constantly sets itself up for interesting characterization, conflict, struggle, success, etc... they have so many balls just sitting on the tee, and instead of swinging for the fences they decide to bunt. Constantly. This show was so frustrating to watch, because it was like, actively doing nothing. There's so few characters, and so many walking plot devices. They are constantly telling rather than showing. For god's sake, it's a show about chess and the best way they could figure to convey a game of chess was just, narration over shots of the player's eyes. We know when there was a critical move because they tell us with a bass-boosted sound as the piece gets placed. But *why* is it a critical move??? Show us! Please!\nWe know that she's good at chess because they've told us she's beating these high-ranked players, but for the love of god *show* us! Give us a window into her thought process, show the thirteen moves she's calculating ahead in order to dispatch bad players, and then use that same method of depiction to show us how and when she gets surprised by better players! We know that when he did the thing with the pawn that ruined her game plan or whatever that she got frustrated, because it was so smart, because she tells us as much. But since her plan was never elucidated, I can't connect to her panic when the plan goes wrong, or gets countered. She's already describing it while distressed, so there's no surprise when she \"drops the bomb\" that he saw right through her plan and did a thing that won him the game. I'm like, okay. What's the point in even recounting the game to us if it's not going to make anything about how and why they beat her any clearer...\n\n*So there's this girl, and she's super smart and good at chess... but get this- she's also addicted to drugs!*\n\nAh, so that's going to be like, one of the core conflicts of her character and the story then? Where she has to struggle against her addiction in order to realize her potential as the first notable woman chess prodigy?\n\n*Ha! No. There's never any consequences for her drug abuse, and they actually make her better at chess lol*\n\nNot even when she, as a child, took literal handfuls of tranquilizers?\n\n*Nope she's totally fine in the beginning of the next episode, and no one faces any consequences for it other than she can't play chess downstairs anymore. Orphanage is fine, she doesn't face any social ridicule over it, her health is fine, it's all good.*\n\nOhhhhhkay. So then she must have another character flaw?\n\n*Yea, actually she's got this anger in her that makes her do wrong chess moves sometimes*\n\nOh, huh... that's weird because the rest of characterization and portrayal places her as a polite, measured, confident, independent, near-emotionless woman.\n\n*No you know that she's got an anger in her because we specifically told you she does. It makes her make the wrong chess move sometimes.*\n\nYea okay I know you told us that but I'm just saying that-\n\n*She's got an anger in her.*\n\nOkay, fine. Sure. But man, that sheltered strict boy-less existence in the orphanage is surely going to result in some sort of relationship conflicts right? She's curious about her sexuality but doesn't know how to approach it?\n\n*Nah, not really. She doesn't mess around with relationships really because she's too focused on chess, but the few sexual encounters she does have are all on her own terms, void of conflict, and she states that she enjoyed herself.*\n\nOooookayyyy. What about her adoptive mother? She's kinda interesting, right? Always drinking beer, smoking cigs, taking tranqs- a failed housewife who's been cheated on and clearly has a history of depression?\n\n*Yea! She's great right?*\n\nYea because she's the only main character that has well-communicated and consistent character traits.\n\n*What a tragic character- gets cheated on, finds joy in traveling with her new adopted sister-child, we get introduced to the idea that she's been pen pals with some mexican dude and within the same episode he leaves her and then she dies.*\n\nOh no! Damn, so she couldn't handle the heartbreak once more and then killed herself?\n\n*Uhhh*\n\nOrrrr accidental overdose as she tries to cope?\n\n*Not exactly...*\n\nHer drinking caught up with her finally?\n\n*Hepatitis actually... and we specifically clarify that, once again, the drinks had nothing to do with it because alcohol and drug abuse are consequence free.*\n\nHmm.. so everyone who drinks and uses drugs is cool?\n\n*No not everyone. The college douche who smokes is bad at sex, and the bitch from highschool is now a super sad character... It's kind of a cathartic moment where the dynamic of the \"cool\" girl and the chess girl is reversed because now she's just a young mom housewife who married her highschool sweetheart but clearly has to drink away her depression from not achieving as much as our chess girl hero*\n\nRight- she's not as cool as chess girl, who is good at chess, addicted to tranquilizers, drinks twice as much, and has never had anything resembling a relationship.\n\n*Exactly! Anyway, how about that kid from Love Actually in a cowboy hat?*",

Nothing special in my opinion.\n\nThis sounds like you're reviewing the hype not the show itself. \n\nI get it. Hype is obnoxious, especially if it doesn't tickle our particular fancy.  I just think it's important to try to view \"art\" on its own terms, not let being tired of hearing reviews distort how we process it.  Because it does, whether we realize it or not.  We can't appreciate the story being told properly while a part of brain is actively looking for reasons to be unimpressed.\n\nI haven't seen *Queen's Gambit* yet.  Stories about chess prodigies aren't usually my idea of a good time, but enough ppl I respect have told me to watch it, so I'll probably cave to the peer pressure eventually. If I am underwhelmed by the experience, I'll probably spend more time trying to figure out what I'm missing.  We do all see the world differently, but assuming everybody else is just fucked in the head is as obnoxious as hype.",

If the show were just men, I wouldn't have finished it. I'm a female and I like seeing other women on screen, but I can admit when it's just bad tv. I actually liked the chess scenes, though I know that was boring for some...\n\nAll my roommates did not like it and could not finish it. \n\nThe writing was cringy and shallow. The scenes with the janitor and main character felt like an even cringier karate kid scene. There were some lines that just felt so unnatural and off, and unfortunately some of the acting seemed forced too, which is such a shame because the actors are so talented as individuals. It just didn't work together. I don't know why...\n\nThere was no character arc, and if there was there would be no way to know because we didn't get to know any of the other characters. Every character existed for a few scenes only to push the main character's story along. Maybe they were trying to put us in the shoes of a narcissist?  When you only care about yourself you only see everyone around you as one dimensional people? So we were only seeing a glimpse of other characters through the main characters eyes? But I don't think the writers were clever enough to think that...if they did, they should have explained that somehow. But also when has one dimensional characters ever been interesting. \n\nThere were so many unique concepts to explore in this show and powerful lessons that could have been told with the all the pieces in the show. This show could have explored emptiness in humans when we chase the wind. They could have hit the point home with the mom's character, main character, janitor, the boys. There were so many serious topics brought up, alcoholism, addiction, depression, and theses important conversations were all kind of tossed aside because she just had to learn \"she didn't need the drugs to be a genius, she was always born a genius\" because again she was just pushed along by a character who we only got to know for a second.

When the mom stood up from the piano and said some cheesy line about trying to be a good mom was when it all really went down hill for me. Also the mom dying was so anti-climactic imo and unemotional. Most of all- I completely agree that they had so many balls sitting there waiting...the creepy father who they basically kill off by having move away (what was the pt of that? maybe he came back i dk I didnt finish but still), her addiction, romantic interests etc- the whole Chechov's gun principle- that every element in a story must be necessary or be removed. The competition scenes all became the same and repetitive.  It could have been really excellent, it was so close in a lot of ways which is the only reason I care. It started off so strong and overall the main character was compelling, the set and costume design etc. But ya, I really don't understand how so so many people could overlook these flaws.",

There was no depth to her character or any other eccentric chess character from the movie.\n\nYou would think that a chess movie would have more than one dimension to it unless it was lost in the editing room floor.

Her mother's house and Vegas spring to mind. \n\nThe 60's time period was recreated so well. The OST is beautiful and the use of songs from the time period excellent. The camera work, the lighting. Oh and the costumes that Beth wore I mean damn! \n\nIf the Queen's Gambit does not win every award there is, it will be a travesty!",

She'll let the next episode play and then watch 5 or 10 minutes to see if she wants to watch another episode. Weird, I know, but people do it.\n\nOh, and then theres my dad who fast forwards through some scenes if he's seen the show already.\n\nAnd even me, I hate not watching an episode to the end. But sometimes I have to stop to take care of something around the house or run an errand.\n\nAnd then there is some short form content, like Love Death and Robots that has 1 episode that's only 6 minutes. \n\nThere is no perfect solution. Sure Netflix's viewer numbers are over inflated by having the watch time at only 2 minutes. But having a system of 'need to watch the entire episode in 1 go' would underreport viewers.\n\nMaybe a better way to think about this number is viewings rather than viewers? For example, if I split an episode into 2 chunks I'm counted twice in their numbers, but I did use Netflix on 2 separate occasions, so I viewed Netflix twice even though I'm only 1 person.",

They're different types of shows for different audiences and the latter already has a big fanbase that is more likely to watch the entire season. I'd assume there's a huge difference in terms in terms of the number of people who would stop the show a couple of minutes in. They should at least keep the count for half an hour or something instead of just 2 minutes.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, The Queen's Gambit was watched by 551 million minutes worth of viewers on its opening weekend, which I'm pretty sure is much lower than what Stranger Things season 3 would've gotten.\n\nEdit: I don't doubt that The Queen's Gambit is Netflix's most popular limited series. I just think the metric Netflix uses is pretty bad. For comparison, Bly Manor got 1.8 billion minutes worth of viewers on its opening weekend according to Nielsen. Stranger Things Season 3 likely was around that mark rather than the 551 mil The Queen's Gambit has.",

Even some more off-beat streaming shows like Disney's new Mickey Mouse and Peacock's Amber Ruffin show have been solid. Not to mention, some more acclaimed shows I didn't even get around to like I May Destroy You, The Last Dance, Betty, Cheer, Little America, and Industry.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Is this just recency bias or is 2020 really an all-timer for debuts? I'm hoping it's the latter because w/ the recent finales of Veep, Thrones, BoJack, The Good Place, and Saul (still-to-come), I was worried about a nadir. Doesn't seem like that's the case, unless it's just been a long isolation.\n\nSome other potential contenders:\n\n1999 (The Sopranos, Family Guy, Futurama, SpongeBob, Judging Amy, The West Wing, Freaks and Geeks)\n\n2005 (Avatar, The Office, Always Sunny, Grey's Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother, The Colbert Report)\n\n2009 (Parks and Rec, Glee, Archer, Community, Bored to Death, Modern Family)\n\n2013 (The Americans, Nathan for You, Parts Unknown, Inside Amy Schumer, Ray Donovan, Drunk History, House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Rick and Morty)",

It's free and has lots of features.  I enjoy blitz and daily puzzles.  You can chat on there too, and if you meet someone who just wants to play some nice slow games and trust them not to cheat with an engine, you can play by correspondence and just manually move the pieces on your real board if you want to have more of a classic experience.

The protagonist has a tough struggle at a young age but has insane amount of potential. She has a strong desire to improve herself. She faces challenges to her abilities, skills and maturity. She grows her raw power on her own but, in the end, she learns she needs team work to win it all. And this was stressed to her through out the show but she was stubborn for awhile about trying to do it on her own instead.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the show:\n\nIt is set during the Cold War era. It is about an orphan girl striving to be the next best chess player in the world. (You do not need to be into chess to enjoy this show.) She meets many people along her journey that all help her in some way or another.\n\nEdit:\n\nYou guys are no fun.",

        "text": "The well-executed Netflix mini-series *Queen\u2019s Gambit* boasts incredibly precise chess sequences, supervised in part by the legendary chess World Champion Garry Kasparov. Many articles and chess enthusiasts have showered their praises on the realistic portrayal of chess in the show. But what about the realism of the story itself? How realistic is, say, the story of an American woman becoming world chess champion in the 1960s?\n\n*Queen\u2019s Gambit*, based on a novel of the same name, is a work of fiction, but not far from the real thing. The Soviet\u2019s did have a stranglehold on chess in the 60s, and an American did rise up from humble beginnings to beat them at their own game. The only real difference between reality and fiction is in the star of the show: in real life, a young man from Brooklyn named Bobby Fischer, and in *Queen\u2019s Gambit*, an orphaned young woman named Beth Harmon.\n\nThe show established early on that chess was traditionally a man\u2019s game. \u201cGirls do not play chess,\u201d said the orphanage janitor to a 9-year-old Beth, refusing to play her. But eventually, he did play her. And she was good. Really good. So good, in fact, that she quickly rose through the ranks of the chess world, proving herself a chess prodigy.\n\nSo, how did the show approach the fact that Beth Harmon was a woman in a game dominated by men, in a time period of intense sexism? In short, the show kept it light. The first few episodes touched on but ultimately watered down the intensely sexist history of the game. At Beth\u2019s first chess tournament, the boys initially scoffed at her playing and paired her with the only other girl competing. But once those boys realized she had talent, her gender no longer mattered much. Even Beth herself hoped it didn\u2019t matter, criticizing an article written about her that focused too much on the fact that she's a woman.\n\nBut the show leaves a question unanswered. If chess is such a meritocracy, where any prodigy will quickly rise through the ranks as a superstar, then why does the life of Beth Harmon only exist in fiction? Why did not a single woman compete in the World Chess Championships in the 20th century?\n\nThe US probably had unknown chess prodigies living in orphanages around the country in the 1960s. The US probably had many incredible chess players who were women and/or people of color. But none ever rose to the top of the chess world, because these groups were essentially banned from competitive play. A woman like Beth would have had continuous, unrelenting harassment at every tournament. Many tournaments would not allow her to play at all, and many men would likely refuse to play her, no matter how good she was. Even a person as tough as Beth would have given up in such a system. Eventually, it simply wouldn\u2019t have been worth it.\n\nBobby Fischer, Beth Harmon\u2019s real-world, male counterpart, also came from humble beginnings and rose to the top of the chess world, besting the top Soviet players. \u201cMen and women shouldn\u2019t play together,\u201d said teenage Fischer in 1961, right around when fictional Beth Harmon would have been improving her game at the orphanage, \u201cI don\u2019t think \\[women\\] should mess into intellectual affairs, they should keep strictly to the home.\u201d\n\nOne of the following must be true: either women in the 1960s weren\u2019t smart enough or tough enough to be chess prodigies, or the chess world was so hostile to women that it was impossible for them to operate within it. But all we needed was one woman with the brains and guts to take on the chess patriarchy, right? Wouldn\u2019t we all like to think so.\n\nGiven the show\u2019s pitch-perfect chess playing and its story of a US prodigy against the Soviet chess machine, it may feel tempting to think that Beth Harmon's story fits into the realm of the realistic. But the sad truth is that a realistic portrayal of a female chess prodigy in the 1960s would be depressing, uninspiring, and certainly no fun to watch.\n\nWe live in a world where TV-goers intensely scrutinize the \u201caccuracy\u201d of a show. Gone are the days of silly, cartoonish hacking sequences. Now, we have *Mr. Robot*. The over-the-top courtroom dramas got replaced with *Better Call Saul*, and the gruesome, yet charming criminal underworld of *The Sopranos* became the calculated, by-the-books world of *Ozark*.\n\nBut in an age where Movies and TV have slowly but surely given more historical accounts of women and people of color, those accounts haven\u2019t endured the same quest for realism.\n\n\u201cI hate all civil rights movies,\u201d said Chris Rock, in an interview with fellow comedian Neal Brennan, \u201cI applaud the effort, and they should exist. The problem is, they only show the back of the bus and the lunch counter. They actually make racism look very, like, fixable.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps the blame for this reduction of sexism and racism cannot simply go on the creators of these films, but partly on the very nature of narrative storytelling. Stories like *Queen\u2019s Gambit* are bound by the rules of the Hero\u2019s Journey. Even if Harmon doesn\u2019t win in the end, she still must have some obstacle to overcome, some lesson to learn. Would there be anything to learn or overcome in a story of unrelenting, brutal sexism?\n\nIn the end, a factually accurate story of sexism in chess would have been simply unwatchable, because in reality, sexism is unbearable to watch. And there\u2019s no money to be made in unwatchable TV shows, so we are left with tepid sexism that Beth can overcome with some brains and hard work, achieving the ultimate fantasy of the classical liberal.\n\nBut I still thoroughly enjoyed *Queen\u2019s Gambit*, and I agree with Chris Rock that these stories should exist. Is there a time and a place for entertaining media with non-traditional stories, even if they may withhold some of the true weight of their ordeals? I certainly hope so. I see a lot of fun and value in watching a non-default character become the default hero.\n\nAnd yet, I am reminded of the game of chess itself. The Queen is the most powerful piece on the board, able to move all spaces in any direction. But despite her incredible ability to win games, she will always remain less valuable than the King, a weaker but much more important piece. Those are the rules of the game.\n\nSo in the end, does *Queen\u2019s Gambit* make a sacrifice? Yes. But in service of what? And in service of who?\n\nOriginally posted [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/43998442)",

                "comment_text": "While no doubt there was sexism in Chess as there is sexism everywhere, there is a significant disparity between men's and women's top-end capabilities at the game of Chess.\n\nIt is likely this disparity arises from two factors:  \n1. Men have greater variance than women. For virtually any field of endeavor - regardless of underlying advantages for one sex - men will be both the top and bottom performers because the distribution of talents amongst men is wider than the distribution of talents amongst women.  \n2. Men have better spatial reasoning than women. Whether you're talking about throw a spear, parking a car or analyzing a game board, men appear to have a higher average performance.\n\nMoreover, issues of sexism/racism aren't really ever about the top performers. If someone can perform at an elite level, the cost of judging them based on their identity rather than their skill is tremendous. As a result, people don't do it. If you're Jesse Owens living in a deeply racist country, you still get to join the Olympic track and field team because the white alternative to Jesse Owens isn't going to win 4 gold medals.\n\nIf you're Jesse Owens living in a deeply racist country trying to get a job stocking shelves at the local supermarket, there are plenty of white people who can do that job just fine and there's no significant cost to a racist preference for whites.",

If someone can perform at an elite level, the cost of judging them based on their identity rather than their skill is tremendous. As a result, people don't do it. If you're Jesse Owens living in a deeply racist country, you still get to join the Olympic track and field team because the white alternative to Jesse Owens isn't going to win 4 gold medals.\n> \n> If you're Jesse Owens living in a deeply racist country trying to get a job stocking shelves at the local supermarket, there are plenty of white people who can do that job just fine and there's no significant cost to a racist preference for whites.\n\nI don't think this applies to chess in the way it does sprinting. If you're fast it's immediately apparent, yes a coach will be able to train you to run faster but it's going to be very obvious if a kid is quick. That isn't the case with chess, you aren't going to beat more than a low level player unless someone is teaching you how to play properly because it's not a game you can figure out (at high level play) yourself unless someone has taught you the fundamentals in strategy. It would be very easy for a potential chess prodigy to go undiscovered if they were never encouraged to learn the game and hence it would be very easy for a talent scout to dismiss someone based on their gender and assume they wouldn't be capable of understanding the game at the level necessary. \n\nThere actually was an elite female player, [Judit Polg\u00e1r](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg\u00e1r), who got to number 8 in the world in the men's rankings. The only reason she got as good as she did is because her dad pushed heavily against the Hungarian chess federation who felt that women were naturally weaker at chess than men and so repeatedly refused to let her and her sister (who whilst never being as good as Judit also went on to be a grandmaster) play in men's events. If her dad hadn't taken it upon himself to provide elite coaching for them since the chess federation weren't interested then Judit likely would never have made it to where she did.",

Specifically relating to the main character being a woman in a male dominated field in the 60s.\n\nThis got me thinking, perhaps the show could've more hard-hitting and 'quality'. I have no doubt if it were a HBO production, this would be the case. More darker scenes for impact and to raise the stakes. Won't spoil anything with examples, but you can imagine it if you've watched the show.\n\nThere is no shortage of darker, top-tier dramas these days. So to watch a new one which isn't so, it's a welcome relief. \n\nIt's still a quality series, just with an unexpected 'feel-good' factor to it.",

Did she let Benny win the speed chess, and did she do that to gain information - advantage - which she used to beat him? Wikipedia claims so, though the show didn't make any reference to that other than you as a viewer making that assumption, and I guess her being really good at it against him later.\n\n2. So Townes was gay or what? I never got that until I read discussion thread. I thought the \"confused\" part was simply about her, not his sexuality as whole, and the guy who came to his room was more \"guy awkwardly ruining what Beth saw as romantic moment that'd escalate to sex\", not \"gay partner awkwardly entering room while she was there\".\n\n3. Why did  she want to psych that kid out that much and talked to him about \"what you're going to do after you become the champion?\" in kinda weird tone, but then was really nice to him\n\n4. How did that last tournament work? It didn't seem to be brackets as she played at least 4 people from what I counted, and IIRC even second day, more than 2 players played, but she didn't play Borgov until the last day when there were no other players anymore. Also I counted 7 players introduced, I guess they skipped over the 8th, but it's weird because IIRC there were supposed to be 4 from USSR (not only the 3 who were introduced), but when they were helping the \"tiger' (the very nice Russian GM), there were still only 3.\n\n5. Cleo - just \"irresponsible\" person living in the moment, or did have any ulterior motives/in any way use Beth?\n\n6. Was there something more to the mother's death, than her simply dying because of being long term alcoholic?\n\n7. I'm still kinda confused about how to understand the whole thing with Beth and Beltik in first half of ep5. Like, the scene where she was dancing and singing when he came out of the toilet, the scene where he was listening to music in his room and Beth was walking there, feeling bad for not having his attention? I understand the gist of the relationship, and some things, but it'd still be great to get some clarity on it as a whole, and then especially on the specific things/scenes.\n\n8. Her (bio) mother wanted to kill her too, right?",

It showed how ill prepared he was for anything but chess and he could be thrown off his game by something unexpected.\n4. I don\u2019t know the rules of tournaments. Maybe a time thing or prep for the super bowl of chess.\n5. She live carefree which Beth could not do if she wanted to compete. \n6. She died of hepatitis and probably had severe depression which the alcohol didn\u2019t help \n7.  Again it\u2019s about distractions. She is used to getting what she wants and toys with the idea of manipulating others who are rivals. The irony is she was charmed as well by Cleo which caused her to lose a match.\n8.

He needed to not realize the thing with the rook. \n\n4) I dunno. \n\n5) I had a *feeling* that Cleo *might* have been hired by the Russians to distract our girl in Paris. It is not substantiated in the show, so I\u2019m not married to the idea, but it is fun spy shit. \n\n6) Parents die in shows and books to unmoor the more important younger characters and to add drama and to create internal conflict for them to overcome. \n\n7) She was horny but didn\u2019t have the guts to knock on his door, or was afraid he\u2019d say no if she did. \n\n8) Yeah, her mom was trying to kill her too.",

That was there to show that Benny was somewhat on her level so he was capable of teaching her in New York.\n* Townes was gay\n* Not sure\n* Didn't really focus on the structure of the tournament so I'm not sure.  Perhaps it was a regular tournament and there were games that weren't happening at the same time.  Or perhaps there were fewer and fewer tables each time.\n* Not sure.  May have been irresponsible, may have been a spy.\n* I think the alcohol exacerbated the hepatitis.\n* Beltik was into her, maybe she was looking for a distraction because her mom just died.  Beltik was looking for a future with her but realized 1) She was obsessed with chess in a way he no longer was 2) She was far better than him so he couldn't really help her or speak to her as a contemporary about it 3) She was an addict going down a dark path 4) She wasn't the girl he imagined over the years.  So his obsession died and he left.\n* I think her bio mother only wanted to kill herself.  She knew she wasn't capable of giving Beth the upbringing she needed.  She thought it was impossible to better herself.  But she couldn't stomach the idea of just giving her up for adoption.  So she killed herself.",

Maybe it would be redeemable if she was a likable character, but everybody in the first two episodes just felt like 1-D cardboard cutouts that showed no personality.

The most risqu\u00e9 or interesting moments catching their attention while they catch up on their friend\u2019s insta stories. For me, I typically prefer to keep my attention laser-focused.

The girl who plays chess in her mind... It feels like those \"Now you see me\" movies where they pull amazing magic tricks that should leave everyone flabbergasted but they don't because.... its fiction, never properly fundamented in terms of veracity and it often involves CGI. I can't root for a fictional character who is an unjustified master of chess. It's like rooting for superman. \n\n It has some good stuff. It is speckled with some interesting peeks into  \n1 - talent vs obsession  \n2 -  finding your path vs being put where society explicitely and implicitily tells you should be  \n3 - how people try to escape from their circumstances: addiction, skills, obsession etc.\n\nBut, plenty of stories that take place in the 50's have approached #2, especially regarding women. Plenty of stories in the sixties have approached #3. And nearly all films about real musicians and cientists have done good, veracity based takes on #1, #2 and #3\n\nI think in a way it suffers from the same problem as the Whiplash movie. Abstract notion of talent + obsession + adiction and self-destruction + unrelatable character (all other characters seem more interesting to me).\n\nAs for the hero's journey (starting point - purpose - obstacle - ally - overcome obsctacle - new obstacle - purpose - ally - overcome - new person/new circumstance) I don't find the take is new and it suffers from being too obvious: the purpose is always the same, the obstacles are always the same.",

Like show snippets of some actual moves and explain what's happening. Like - an onscreen map graphic to show a journey or a visual of a heist plan. They should have shown bits of the actual sequences with commentary as voice-over. It's like they were convinced that they would lose the audience if they even tried to show some actual chess. Even just a little bit.\n\nThe other problem is that chess, like other sports, sort of reflects the personality of the player. Events in their career would shape the games themselves. Like there are people who favor Knights or Bishops as their favorite piece because of certain reasons. Or tend to commonly use certain strategies for certain reasons. The protagonist's chess story feels splintered because her chess games are borrowed from other games that happened in real life. A hodge podge of someone else's games.",

        "text": "I have to put this in here because I know everyone will tell me why limited series are done so without further ado: I completely understand why this particular show has a limited release. A show about chess isn't something Netflix would be particularly fond of renewing for multiple seasons, nor do I feel like Scott Frank (writer/director) wants more seasons. It has a beginning middle and end, so it's basically a perfect arc as is. \n\n\nWith that being said, I really wish this show had more to it. Often times I feel as though Harmon is too good at chess, beating even the (spoiler obviously) US champion within only the 5th or 6th episode? She is waaaay too OP for her own good, even beating him basically every single time *after* she wins him the one time before. The show writer, Frank, makes it so that all Harmon has to do is study some books and read some magazines and PRESTO, she's better than everyone (which would be perfectly fine if we were given more time to study with her as a character, to watch her grow more subtly). \n\n\nHarmon also has an alcohol problem supposedly, which I started to find really odd because we only see her *truly* drunk and losing it like once out of the entire show. It would've been nice to see this side of her come out more often since it's obviously a big part of her character.\n\n\nObviously, characters like Benny, Townes, Harry, Jolene, the twins were all so good in the show that I felt like I wanted to see more of them. We don't see more than what we were given though due to the show's short season (albeit long-ish episodes). All of them feel more substantial than just one off characters and I wish there was more to them (especially Benny Watts cuz damn Thomas Brodie is good).\n\n\nI should mention that this isn't the first time I've felt this way with another Scott Frank series. The show 'Godless' is also fantastic but very short lived. I wish there was another season of that too even moreso than Queen's Gambit.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, tl;dr: I want more of the characters within new seasons. More, more, more!",

A show about chess isn't something Netflix would be particularly fond of renewing for multiple seasons, nor do I feel like Scott Frank (writer/director) wants more seasons.\n\nBut also, in my opinion, this story couldn't be done as a anything other than a limited series. They'd have to expand or stray away from the source material... or have a completely different execution which would mean a almost completely different series. \n\n> I really wish this show had more to it.\n\nAs you alluded to (whether on purpose of not), Harmon's character presentation could've been better. I feel there is a lot more they could've explored, like her alcoholism as you said or even her sex life and sexual curiosities from a young age etc. Some things were just shown/hinted but never got any real development.",

Maybe Scott Frank knew from the start this would never be a recurring show on something like Netflix, so he wrote it to be a condensed version of the book.

Should I also point out that Jolene, Harry, her mother, reporters at chess tournaments, etc, etc also point out her supposed drinking problem? It's one thing to have exposition point out someone's problem, it's a whole other world when we physically have to see her suffer through agonizing drinking scenarios though. None of which are really brought up except when referenced by someone else. I hate exposition. It ruins a perfectly good idea by skimming through it using useless words. This show has so many people bring up her incredulous drinking problem, yet I swear she is only out of control one time.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that people that drink aren't always \"out of control\" which was something I referenced. You are right. I agree with you entirely. But there isn't anything wrong with drinking occasionally either (which is what I saw more often than her over drinking). This is what really annoyed me. I'm supposed to assume after her drinking a single sip of alcohol that she's suddenly an alcoholic because someone mentions it to her. Fuck outta here with that nonsense.",

I saw multiple undeveloped side characters leading one main character to the top for a victorious finale and then.... Yeah, nothing. Interesting, sure, but unfinished.\n\nI also love how everyone that commented decided to mention the same thing I mentioned a few times which is the \"perfect\" arc. The elusive \"save the cat\" beginning, middle, and end that Scott Frank achieves quite effortlessly. It's very well done, but unsatisfying when presented in such a long fashion like a television show. It's like a movie that has one character and a few specific traits throughout the entirety. She certainly didn't change (or even mature) like I hoped she would have. But whatever, I said it before-- we clearly don't see eye-to-eye.\n\nI should mention your thoughts on this fiction book. Obviously people come along that are quite incredible and talented, but think back on the episodes where she couldn't beat Watts to save her life. Then, out of no where, she can beat him and 2 other people simultaneously at speed chess, a game she has never even taken the time to learn properly. Not only does she beat them multiple times, but she beats them *every* (and I literally mean every) single time afterwards. Fiction or not, either the book lazily wrote that in (which I doubt), Frank wrote that in (doubt), or there wasn't enough screen time (bingo). And yes, this is one instance, but trust me when I say there are multiple instances like this.\n\nThe one thing I agree 100% with you on is her winning at her age. Prodigy's are clearly a thing, I never doubted that. The fact that I have to accept that she can, I guess, \"imagine chess pieces on a ceiling\" (as if that's what a real prodigy would do) is what really annoys me. She doesn't seem to struggle, like, EVER. Imagine a football team winning Superbowl every year because they are just that good. Imagine Elon Musk just solving all of the world's problems every single day without fail because he's just that smart. That doesn't happen. There are downfalls to everyone, even chess, and I'll be damned to just let a simplistic answer like \"she's just that good\" slide. Even when she's at her worst, she's still seemingly at her best and it's somewhat obnoxious. \n\nAgree to disagree though, clearly I should've shut my mouth on this topic as not a single person wants more of this show I guess.",

Borgov was actually quite dismissive of his yes-men sidekicks when they were discussing Beth, and he was very warm when he lost the final.\n\n5.

But they took the time to choreograph each game of chess perfectly to the level expected by the plot, including 1960s grandmaster level and make every line of chess-related dialog accurate.",

It went from a complex character drama about a traumatized genius struggling with addiction - chess, love, sex, drugs, alcohol, dependency - into a kind of Saturday morning cartoon where her lost love shows up out of the blue and all her friends/exes break character to team up and help save the day.  I felt like the whole show was a study into this kind of obsessive compulsive behaviour and how people can struggle to define and balance themselves in the face of loss.  But everything just resolved itself and tied itself up with a somewhat cheap 'together we can do anything' bow.  While it was nice to see characters I emotionally connected with get happy endings, it also felt like everything that came before just lost a lot of its poignancy.\")\n\nBut great show nonetheless.  Fantastic direction, especially with how every chess match/tournament is shot and conveyed.\n\n___\n\nEdit: A lot of people explaining the ending to me (and downvoting me for saying as much). I got it. I understand what happened. I understand what they were going for. I get it. I get the unplanned move.  I get her adapting herself.  I got it.\n\nMy point is that I didn't like it, and I would have preferred it went a different direction.  \n\n[spoiler](#s \"The show was very much about addiction and growing past your yourself.  From Benny (who seemed like a superstar until you see his home and see what his obsessive lifestyle had done to him), to Harry (who came to terms with it, and grew out of it; not determining his value as a person by his skill but by how he treated others - hence the grocery store line), to even Mrs. Wheatley (who's injury clearly diminished her from a woman who was strictly and absolutely in control, from her orphanage to her soul).  That all is fleeting and life takes everything away; nothing lasts and no man/woman is king forever, and those who come to terms with it, and those who hurtle towards it like a car over a cliff.\")\n\n[spoiler](#s \"The point is that Beth's growth as a player shouldn't have been the focus, but rather her growth as a person; the chess was a backdrop to her humanity, not her superpower to beat the villains.  All the value she had for herself, because of her abandonment and trauma, came from chess.  That in all other aspects of life, she was awkward and alien to the world around her.  And disassociating from that, and growing the way Harry or Jolene had, should have been the point.  It should have been about learning to resolve the issues she'd spent her life running from.  Her addiction wasn't pills and alcohol, it was estrangement and escapism.\")\n\n[spoiler](#s \"But then, in a very strange turn, it all just became a punch up with the big bad Russians that Team America had to defeat, and Beth's journey was more or less pointless because her learning to not use drugs and 'she had it in her all along'...was somehow the new point?  And it's fine, it was well handled.  But that's also the story of Teen Wolf.  That's the story and theme of hundreds of thousands of children's stories where 'someone hurt overcomes their mistrust and learns to work as a team' or 'it was in me all along' is the end lesson and it just felt like the show was building towards something different and more nuanced, rather than something so childish and simple.\")\n\nJust my two cents anyway (since I'm being downvoted for trying to explain myself below).",

I can see the value in telling empowering stories to girls, even if it can sometimes mean embellishing things a bit. This show does much more than a little embellishing though.\n\nDuring the 1960s, a time when there where very few professional female chess players, Beth is not only better than any other male player in the entire world, she is also in her early 20s and looks like a model... \n\nEven if this movie was made about a modern day female chess prodigy who was born into a family of grandmasters, I would still find it hard to believe.",

She enabled Beth's obsession for the game when she realized she could earn money from it. She basically started her daughter's alcohol addiction at a young age. But she wasn't a villain. Not at all in fact. She was kind, supportive, thoughtful too. I was genuinely sad for Beth when she died. Not only was she all those things all along, she actually developed a much more meaningful bond with Beth over all those years. I would bet on it that would Beth ever cease to be able to play, she would've stood by her side proudly regardless of her losing that ability. If she hadn't died first, that is. It was a wonderful story in a way and shows the intricacies of good/bad that reflect the real world instead of an overdone, overdramaticized trope in fiction.",

Every clich\u00e9 that I expected did not come to fruition, and characters went in directions that were unpredictable to me.\n\nI had to force myself not to look up whether Beth Harmon was a real person or not until it was over, and even then by the finale I still didn't know. I don't know tennis, either. For all I knew Beth Harmon died in Russia a year later and you can today still visit her at the Kremlin like John Reed.

Not only did the main character need a community to win against the Russians, she needed a community to help her overcome the much scarier adversaries of addiction, trauma, and depression.  The attitude of independence in American chess mirrored her own sense of independence caused by the trauma she had experienced becoming an orphan.  Her family didn't want her, and the last lesson her mother taught her before her mother's suicide (and homicide, and attempted filicide) was \"don't rely on anyone for anything.\"  This lesson was further ingrained in her life with her adoptive father abandoning her and her adoptive mother.  Even her adopted mother \"abandoned\" her, by dying.\n\nThe whole story is about the main character unlearning the lessons of this trauma, about letting her walls down and becoming vulnerable in spite of all the hurt she had endured telling her otherwise.  When she finally realizes that she has a group of people who truly care about her, that her mentor truly cared about her, that her friend from the orphanage truly cares about her, it is then that she is able to face her demons.  \n\nThe redemption is what makes this story worth telling.  Otherwise, it would have just been another sad story of a sad person meeting a sad end.",

And then she finally stops trying to do everything herself and lets other people help her and accepts that help graciously - and that help puts her in the right position to win, but he breaks script and she still has to improvise to finish the game.",

When I watch movies I have this constant feeling that it's rushed, since they're trying to fit all the important stuff into too small of a time frame, so for me movies tend to lack some of the great stuff mini series get to have.

Sometimes movies also seem to skip some parts of the plot and just imply them instead, whereas these series have time to explore them, and some more of the \"minor\" parts of the story which enriches it overall and gets me more invested.

I can\u2019t think of many other games that can do this.\n\nThe Netflix show did a great job at portraying this too... Elizabeth is known for playing spectacular, wild attacking chess and I feel that reflects her not-completely-stable personality very well.  Borgov is quiet and calculating as a person, and his chess reflects that with his positional play and preference for closed positions.\n\nAnyways, best of luck if you do decide to get into it!",

During that conversation in the hotel in the final episode he mentioned something along the lines of it being his fault, him not being sure or whatever. I guess they tried to tell us he's figuring out whether he's gay, bi or whatever and that he struggled with it at that time. But idk. That was one of the most confusing parts of the show for me because in the end since stuff started to depend on it (unrequited love was mentioned once or twice) and I still wasn't sure about what happened exactly.",

An awkward, unorthodox one with rarely a word said on both sides, but it was a relationship nonetheless, with trust, and caring. What speaks volumes is that she knew that of all the people in her then small world, he would be one who she could reach out to who might care enough about her to spare $5 for her entry fee into the tournament.\n\nAlso, he also wasn't just a funny old man who played chess to her. In the Life interview, she tells the reporter that Mr. Shaibel was the janitor at Methuen who taught her how to play chess. His omission is the second thing she mentions as one of her complaints about the Life article--the first being the article only focused on her being a girl. It is especially telling when she actually puts her hand on his shoulder during their photo together. She cared for him as well.",

Possible but unlikely)\n\nAnyways, she finally loses her virginity and the dude can\u2019t even stay hard. Plus the pain / shock of the first time, basically not a great lay.\n\nThen she has sex with a guy who\u2019s clearly in love with her but she sees as more of a colleague or friend. \n\nThe sex keeps him there, helping her, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s satisfying nor is it something she wants to avoid. She actually is looking at lingerie when she runs into her old schoolmate.\n\nBut when she finally fucks a guy she\u2019s actually hot for? And he\u2019s actually a good lay? It changes her perception entirely on the subject.\n\nHe\u2019s too much like her though, and it quickly fizzles out.\n\nThe bi-experience was somewhat hinted at in NY, but ended up being a nerdy as hell \u201cparty\u201d of chess but when they first walk in it legit feels like the host is about to spring a gang bang on her like no big deal.\n\nI was a bit surprised by the morning scene but not entirely.\n\nI don\u2019t think any of her sexuality or sexual experiences has to do with how generally dead inside she seems to act with other people, and definitely not above or below until way way later.\n\nIt\u2019s more that she\u2019s used to getting nothing but pain from others and is extremely slow to trust. But she\u2019s also loyal quickly once that trust is truly earned. \n\nThe only time she doesn\u2019t really pay back someone correctly was when shes at rock bottom and the pre-med student tells her she\u2019s an inspiration.",

She doesn't know how relationships or sex really work, so she's playing along.\n\nI agree that Benny was an important point though, I think having ambivalent, complicated feelings and avoiding the person you have them for is part of her arc.

All the time you see things like \"Netflix is not as good as HBO, I'll take HBO quality over quantity\". Yet they don't even recognize that's not the game Netflix is trying to or wanting to play. Netflix is the biggest streaming service bar none and there's a reason for that.\n\nTheir goal isn't to have a smaller curated selection of movies and tv shows that are all beloved by critics. Their goal is to replace the modern cable watching habit. Instead of channel surfing, they want you to get on Netflix look through their shows and try them out. It's why they've thrown out such a wide net and are so quick to kill things that don't work. \n\nThe whole killing things that don't work is a double edged sword no doubt. There's potential to lose peoples interest when they can't trust a show they enjoy will see a proper end. But for Netflix the benefit are greater than the negatives currently because it gives them a ton of useful information. The data they garner from release 4-5 shows a month, probably more at this point, is invaluable to them when it comes to their future success. So sure right now it's rocky, but in 4-5 years when they've got their content creation/buying down to a science and Netflix grows even more they will have the last laugh. \n\nNow obviously there's a ton of discussion to be had about the whole algorithm approach to media creation and consumption, but that's a whole different topic that can be talked about at length.",

I'm assuming Alma finds out or is a goof in production. Regardless the very year she is adopted she wins the Kentucky State Championship and her mom, Alma decides to enter Beth into more tournaments.\n\nIt's in episode 3 that we get our first timestamp 1963 (ergo she is still 15 in 1963). Then it cuts forward three years to 1966 where Beth is at the U.S opens in Las Vegas. At this point she is now 18. It is also in this episode when Beth graduates highschool. Her real age must have been known to all at this point because of her fame.  \n\n\nEpisode 4 in mexico city, it is still 1966 and she is said to be 17 years old by the Mexican chess announcer. This is wrong.   \n\n\nEpisode 5 it is 1967. Harry Beltik shows up and says what happened to the little girl who kicked my ass 5 years ago, this may or may not be a goof, but I think its plausible if we take the Kentucky chess tournament happening at the beginning of 1963. So she is now at the U.S chess championships and she is age 19.   \n\n\nEpisode 6 after he time with Benny, she is now in Paris, still 1967. So she is still 19.  \n\n\nEpisode 7 we are shown a that it is Moscow 1968. She is twenty years old. After her game with Luchenko, she is asked her age to which she replies twenty. She is politely cut off because she can say anything else, but we can assume she is twenty/twenty one.",

But she clearly said she was 15 when she met her adoptive parents. What gives?\n\nI think the director/producer just screwed up. Everything would make more sense if that date on the certificate had been 1947. Then she would have indeed been 15 when adopted, and she would have been 21 in 1968 in Moscow (she starts to tell Luchenko her age is 21, but he cuts her off).

Episode 3 takes place over a couple of years while Beth gets her rating up to 1800, and she missed one Vegas event because her mother was sick. Thus their encounter in Episode 3 is almost 2 years after the first meeting, or even another year later. His seduction attempt includes a comment on how much more adult she looks.\n\nSo most likely Beth is 17. That fits both Townes' behavior and her mother's.",

It's interesting actually now that you mention it because that girl Beth was sitting at lunch with (the girl Beth inquired about school chess club) suggested 'you should try out for junior cheerleader' and those are usually up to 14 years old, although in cases it goes up to 18. The classification is wonky.  \n\n\nAnyway idk i don't think the showrunners would want to run the risk of misconstruing her age on an exposition line that we will use as a reference for her age throughout the show.

If that's the case, then have at it - I guess you can entertain yourself anytime you like .\n\nBut if your answer has any merit or sincerity behind it... I think you owe yourself as well as the person who originally asked the question a huge apology. \n\nI don't think the person asking the question is being any way obsessive. I'm a casual viewer and I've been trying to work out the timeline, having nothing to do with sex, intimacy, or for any reason that you so adamantly assumed and attached to the question with your aggressive response... It is an interesting question for the series in general - it does not mean it was a bad series - just a question - something so innocent and so simple and you just kind of have a meltdown - I'm a little embarrassed for you, but I don't want to be because as a human being I'm concerned about any individual that would have such a visceral reaction to a simple question. \n\nAnd the reason I feel you owe yourself an apology is because your answer showed such a lack of self-respect and anger... But that anger seems to be directed more at yourself and your own life. I hope you take this opportunity to look at your own thoughts - anger - your ability to socialize online and likely in person as well. You don't seem like a happy person, but you could be. Learn to love yourself and not automatically think so poorly of other people. Try not to make rash decisions on others, and others will likely start reducing the judgments they place on you that may be unreasonable or completely incorrect. You're robbing yourself of your own anonymity and self-worth - just my opinion. Wishing you the best of luck either way.",

It is therefore very clear that she is adopted in September 1963 at the age of 14 5/6.

Secondly, your body doesn't know when you're going to reproduce either. And people didn't necessarily reproduce at earlier ages than today. Not to mention, why would a later menarche have anything to do with reproducing at an earlier age when menarche signals the start of a woman's fertile years? We have the ability to reproduce at a younger age today if anything. Compare girls getting their periods aged 8 today vs girls not getting their periods until age 16 50, 60, 70+ years ago. That means it's possible for girls today to start having babies ~8 years sooner than they could historically.",

It's on Netflix and it's only 7 episodes long.\n\nThe entirety of the first two episodes all I kept thinking was that the show about chess has no right to be this good! But by the time the third episode started I was so hooked I had to binge the whole thing.\n\nThe finale (appropriately called \"End Game\") really takes the cake - it's so wonderfully heartwarming whilst also remaining incredibly exciting. I can't remember the other time this year that a single episode of television made me cry, laugh and got my heart beat so fast all in the space of one hour. It's filmmaking at its absolute finest and such a fine distraction from all the stuff going on in the world right now.\n\nI now genuinely have a hole in my heart that I didn't even have before yesterday morning, and it will probably be a while before another show like this comes out to fill that hole, so feel free to recommend me stuff, maybe I've missed out on some other great series that have come out in the last few years.",

I binged this whole series today so its all pretty recent.\n\nI thought the first 6 episodes were fantastic. Really really good. But the 7th episode (the last one) felt really cheap? Sure the shots and acting was great, but in terms of story it actually felt bad. \n\nThere was so much tension with her various relationships, with her flashbacks with her real mother and the drugs, but it all seems to disappear in a flash without any satisfying, realistic resolution. How could she suddenly drop the drugs that she had struggled with so much? And the boyfriends together at the end was just odd tbh. Same with thr cheesy hug with Borgov. They had written themselves into a great, human, gritty heroine in Beth but that ending has almost ruined the whole series with how happy ever after it.",

Spoilers.\n\n[spoiler](#s \"Just because a few of the wholesome happy lines kind of took me out of things a bit. e.g. Jolene sinking into a chair and saying \"good job cracker, good job\" is just a bit too much of a TV moment for me, same with the call at the end from all her chess friends. Plus there was a lot of tension missing from the finale since I never for one second believed she would lose. The first half of it though was pretty enjoyable. And even the second half I *liked*, I just liked it as more of a \"What a fuzzy, albeit predictable ending this all has\" kind of nice thing\")\n\nHowever, I was overall really pleasantly surprised. I came at the show from the perspective of being a massive fan of chess, and there was a lot of stuff that was fun for me, while not at all being a show *for* chess fans. A really good balance was struck and while yeah, there are a few minor things that aren't quite right, it does a great job of being both engaging and authentic. \n\nI would love to see the series get popular and encourage more people to try chess out a little. It's so easy to play online and learn, and chess fans in general are very privileged in that they can just go online and see the greatest players in the world (and some of the strongest players of all time) playing and explaining their thoughts. And then they can open a new tab, seek a game and have a pool of people to match with that never dwindles.",

I though they had nice chemistry though\n\n\\- although I liked the last episode, the phone call felt a bit like the avengers?? like it was a nice moment but a really big contrast to the dark tones of the other episodes. same kind of thing with borgov hugging Beth - it seemed so out of character for this really stone cold man they'd built up \n\n\\- maybe longer episodes would have been nice? they did a lot of time jumps and I wish they showed both the actual games and all her different relationships more. would've liked to see more of cleo (she had potential to have been used more) and Townes\n\neven though I'd love a season 2 I don't think I can justify it in terms of storyline",

To see at the greatest time of her need, the Americans whom many had romantic ties to her, get their shit together and help her win was just an encouraging, heartfelt moment for many, me included. \n\nBorgov had respect for Beth for years so it's not out of character to see this person reach their full potential and be happy for them. \n\nGranted, the drug issues was meh but it was a process but ultimately I'll take the happy ending over what is now expected, the \"serious and dark\" ending.",

There's also the all too common emotional turmoil of peaking early and having nothing left to achieve, no reason to get up in the morning. Then she also had the bad luck of circumstances - being an orphan, and possibly having bad mental health genes from her bio mom. \n\nWhile she was definitely working to become a better chess player, she was ultimately battling to become a more successful human being (as was her mom and possibly a few other characters). Someone who could have her gift and all her other baggage and not have it destroy her. Someone who was \"gritty\" yet intelligent and driven enough to find a way to master her own life, partly by understanding what brought her happiness - playing chess - for the love of the game, not just for the accolades. The show was so well done that the ending could have gone either way. Yes it ended with a scene where it felt like she was taking a turn toward happiness but it wasn't out of nowhere - you could see her fighting an internal battle to embrace life throughout the whole show. And that last scene of playing speed chess was another step in that battle. Maybe she would even fall back to drugs and alcohol for a while at some point. But it felt like we were finding out (just as she was) that she wouldn't stop battling and she probably had what it takes to win.",

You have this person who has experienced trauma, loss, and the consequences of those things (addiction). Seeing the old man supporting her in the background and having her friend be there woke her up to the love she felt she had been missing in her life. Those individuals were her real family.

We had no evidence that Borgov was a bad guy from what I remember of the show. I think the show strongly hinted that Americans were overly paranoid about the Russian people and portraying them as evil aka the red scare. The church ladies and her bodyguard asking her to say how glad she is to be an american etc Having Borgov be so gracious and then the final scene where the old russian men are all absolutely thrilled to meet her after she just defeated their own homegrown world champion was meant to represent that. I actually liked that they didn't drag it out. In comparison to the many netflix shows that are absurdly long and have way too many seasons, I thought the compactness was very refreshing and part of what made it so enjoyable to watch.",

But doing it that way is such a force. Beth burned bridges with Benny and Belvik yet they're still bending over backwards for her? How do the two of them know each other again? I'm sure they know of each other, but they hardly seemed friends. Belvik and the twins live in Kentucky, yet they decided to make the multiple day drive up to New York to meet up with Benny for a few days during the tournament? \n\nI'm not advocating for a serious/dark ending, but it would have been good to get a more realistic one.

I think it just ties together how she doesn\u2019t fully notice the people who care for her in the moment, but damn I wish they were able to be reunited in his lifetime. I probably woulda sobbed (even more) like a baby if the finale included some scene of her giving him back the $10.",

        "text": "***Warning! Mild spoilers below!!!***\n\nBased on Walter Tevis's novel of the same name, you could say The Queen's Gambit uses chess as a vehicle to present a shrewd study of genius, influential loneliness, and the allure of addiction. It is however the consistency and emotional weight of it's storytelling that does this series all favors, because The Queen Gambit tells a consistent and well-paced story, one that tonally switches between melancholy and pensive, one that never goes over-the-top nor the least bit absurd, and one that actually takes our main character places, through losses, wins, good times and bad times. \n\nThe Queen's Gambit presents chess in a way I've never seen it before. It almost makes it feel like any other big sport or world-class competition, one where the intimacy between players is like no other. Beth triumphs through her devotion and love of the game, and honestly her endgame is a lot less devastating than the impression that is brought upon us in the earlier episodes.\n\nMy only issue with The Queen's Gambit is that I think it could've explored Beth's character even more. Some parts were glossed over I think, like her curiosity with sex and somewhat complicated relationship with it, or her struggles with socializing being only ever interested in chess. I also feel like her battle with addiction could've been a bit more detailed, if she quit those tranquilizers after years of taking them shouldn't she be having withdrawals?? \n\nThe Queen's Gambit is a great binge though. The acting is great, the visuals are radiant and with only 7-epsiodes it's as well-mannered and polite as the game it features. \n\n    rating: 8.0 out of 10\n\n [Full List of 2020 Write-ups & Ratings](https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_reason_to_livx/comments/g358xw/2020_tv_series_writeups_ratings/)\n\nTop 10 rated:\n\n1.

Because the story of the real best woman chess player ever, Judit Polgar, is so fascinating. Like, why are you making up chess heroines with wild back stories? Judit's parents raised her and her sisters as basically a fully-documented experiment with the explicit plan from birth of making them grandmasters. I want an 8-part Netflix series about them dammit! But a Hungarian social experiment proving her crackpot father (partly) right to become a top-10 player in the world clearly will never have the same drawing power as an American orphan fighting against all odds. Really the player she resembles the most is Bobby Fischer, at least the whole \"no-one can beat the Russians\" plot.\n\nAnyway I quickly overcame my gripes about the premise and fell completely in love with the show. I agree with OP's review that it doesn't quite dig deep enough into Beth's character - nor anyone else's. No-one is one-dimensional but everyone stops short of feeling quite fully fleshed out. And I would've loved to see more of that kid she met in Mexico! I kept hoping he would pop back up and he never did :(\n\nEdit: I can't get the spoiler tag to work. Anyway good show very happy",

After getting hurt so many times i have stopped watching new shows blindly. Earlier it was about being a critical hit for 1 or 2 seasons and shows build up their audience over that period of time. Case in point Breaking Bad and GOT, even Dark falls into the same category. I wonder how netflix missed cancelling that one. Now that i don't watch Netflix multi season series or movies(rarely do anyways, also the quality is going down severely, i call it MCU effect) miniseries might be the only reason to use Netflix.",

Most shows are contained within the season anyway, and yes, I'll be sad when an absolute favorite of mine underperforms, but it's not like you can run eight dozen different shows at once without severely castrating their budgets.\n\nAnd what idiot logic is \"I don't watch shows unless they get a full run\"? Whether they perform well enough is up to you. It's people making a fuzz about their oh-so precious time when the reality is that they just can't be arsed to watch the shows they want picked up for S2.\n\nNetflix has been nothing but a net-positive for streaming and television.

I am speaking from my personal experience. I seem to have been on the receiving end of their programming decisions. Started with Sense8, than it was Glow, Dark Crystal, Santa Clarita Diet, Patriot Act, etc. May sound like as if anything i watch is cursed. But that's not it. One common thread between all these shows has been that they were all Netflix originals with unique premises, concepts and stories. I like shows like these. But everyday Netflix seem to be straying further from that direction. They have adopted this quick turn and burn strategy to make as much noise(via promotion) to get you to subscribe and than leave you stranded. That's how i got suckered into getting their subscription. \n\n\n> B) they release a great mini series you like and your response is still....fuck Netflix. Says more about you and the anti Netflix bias on here than them.\n\nNah, i gave them my money for 4-5 years. That's far too much for the amount of content i mentioned. The miniseries exists because the story which it is based on is one book only. And thanks to great creatives on the helm it succeeds in translating wonderfully from pages to film. It would have been so easy to misunderstand it and turn it toxic, but they didn't. So, i am thankful to the creators not to Netflix. \n\n> C) no one gives a shit what you watch enough for you to start a new thread.

Really hope to see jack in more stuff because he is a damn good actor and he\u2019s still young.  Also ya hell or high water is one of my favorite movies in recent years, absolutely fuckin love that movie, Chris pine\u2019s best role imo and foster and bridges were fantastic like always, that movies never gets old to me, seen it like 5+ times, still need to see outlaw king as well.  White boy rick was a decent movie especially mcconaughey\u2019s performance but 71 is definitely a much better movie by the director ",

He needs a big budget film role to push him into the public eye. People still don\u2019t know who he is. Out of my friends that are kinda cinephiles, they haven\u2019t even seen 71 or starred up sadly. HOHW does have Pines best work and the fascinating part is that he shot the movie in a week before he went onto Star Trek 3. It\u2019s insane. I\u2019ll watch White Boy Rick at some point. Demange was courted for James Bond. I know he\u2019s directed recently for one of the new shows JJ Abrams company is rolling out ",

Ya crazy about HOHW, pine did it really quickly and still delivered his best performance and the movie as a whole was incredible. I\u2019m curious to see what demange does goin forward, thought that James Bond would be a huge gig for him but it fell through, think he has a lot of potential that showed in 71 and you could see flashes of it in white boy rick also ",

        "text": "**Performances**\n\n**15. TIE: Timothy Olyphant, \u201cSanta Clarita Diet\u201d and Andy Daly, \u201cReview\u201d** \u2013 Daly would be much higher if he didn\u2019t have only an hour of screen time this year, but I figured I\u2019d still sneak him on here somehow. It may not seem like it at first, but he actually gives one of the most psychologically complex performances on television. As for Olyphant\u2026I just love Olyphant, and he\u2019s a ton of fun in \u201cSanta Clarita Diet\u201d.\n\n**14. Pamela Adlon, \u201cBetter Things\u201d** \u2013  A refreshingly grounded performance, one that feels honest and real every single week.\n\n**13. Kyle MacLachlan, \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d** \u2013 MacLachlan pulls off a tough job in this season, playing several different versions of one character while ensuring that they feel connected in a manner beyond appearance. Not to mention the fact that he has to sell the humor and horror of Lynch, which is never an easy task.\n\n**12. Issa Rae and Yvonne Orji, \u201cInsecure\u201d** \u2013 As best friends in the show, Rae and Orji deftly navigate all the difficulties of love, work, and friendship.\n\n**11. Nicole Kidman, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d** \u2013 The clear standout from an overall great cast. Her scenes with Skarsgard are the most compelling scenes in the show by a wide margin, and Kidman explores and exposes her character\u2019s psyche like the veteran actor she is.\n\n**10. Sarah Gadon, \u201cAlias Grace\u201d** \u2013 A mesmerizing tightrope of a performance, with every moment of blankness revealing a reservoir of psychological pain.\n\n**9. Rachel Bloom and Donna Lynn Champlin, \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d** \u2013 Bloom\u2019s performance is chock full of energy, but she also nails the struggles her character experiences in the show\u2019s most challenging season to date. Champlin, meanwhile, has quietly been giving one of the best supporting roles on television for the last few years.\n\n**8. Claire Foy, \u201cThe Crown\u201d** \u2013 So intoxicating precisely because Foy is performing as someone perpetually living a performance. She has a special talent for finding the Queen\u2019s emotional core and allowing that to inform every perfectly calibrated element of her powerful, prominent, and even contradictory role in society. This is Foy\u2019s show.\n\n**7. Tatiana Maslany, \u201cOrphan Black\u201d** \u2013 I don\u2019t see her on many lists this year, which makes sense because 1) The show became a shell of its former self, and 2) We all take her for granted at this point. At the same time, it also doesn\u2019t make sense because Maslany is the epitome of versatility and delivers one final incredible run in season five. For each of the past five years, she\u2019s had a very strong case for best performance of the year.\n\n**6. Mackenzie Davis and Kerry Bishe, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d** \u2013 Their characters have gone through their ups and downs, but what remains when all is said and done is a wonderful platonic relationship between two flawed yet resolute women.\n\n**5. Katherine Langford, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d** \u2013 Langford takes what can sometimes be problematic, melodramatic writing and makes it remarkably believable and nuanced. The show\u2019s entire premise hinges on this one character, and without an actor as good as Langford in the role, it\u2019s not going anywhere. Say what you will about the show in general, but Langford is phenomenal.\n\n**4. Maggie Gyllenhaal, \u201cThe Deuce\u201d** \u2013 She displays such an air of assuredness on screen, with just the right mix of warmth and resolve.\n\n**3. Michael McKean, \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d** \u2013 I singled out Seehorn last year, but it has to be McKean this year. Probably the person on this list most capable of making you feel the character\u2019s pain.\n\n**2. Elisabeth Moss, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d** \u2013 Brilliant as always, but her Emmy win for this show should not have been her first.\n\n**1. The Cast of \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d** \u2013 The greatest cast on television. In the show\u2019s final season, regulars like Eccleston and Brenneman deliver incredible performances, but the show ultimately rests on the very capable shoulders of Carrie Coon and Justin Theroux. This is a pairing so tense, so beautiful, so rich in emotion, and the final scenes between them are absolutely stunning. Coon in particular is an acting force to be reckoned with and the greatest performer in today\u2019s television industry.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**: Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d), Aya Cash (\u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d), Carmen Ejogo, Anna Friel, and Louisa Krause (\u201cThe Girlfriend Experience\u201d), Nathan Fielder (\u201cNathan For You\u201d), The cast of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d, Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d), Laura Linney and Jason Bateman (\u201cOzark\u201d), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (\u201cVeep\u201d), Jude Law (\u201cThe Young Pope\u201d), Emmy Rossum (\u201cShameless\u201d), The \u201cFargo\u201d cast, Aubrey Plaza (\u201cLegion\u201d), Logan Browning (\u201cDear White People\u201d), Will Arnett (\u201cBojack Horseman\u201d), Cameron Britton (\u201cMindhunter\u201d)\n\n**Episodes** (one per show)\n\n**15. Mr. Robot, \u201ceps3.5_kill-pr0cess.inc\u201d**\n\n**14. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, \u201cI Never Want to See Josh Again\u201d**\n\n**13. Veep, \u201cBlurb\u201d**\n\n**12. 13 Reasons Why, \u201cTape 7, Side A\u201d** \u2013 Excise the awful setup for the unnecessary season two, and you have one of the most gut-wrenching episodes of television in 2017.\n\n**11. Twin Peaks: The Return, \u201cPart 17\u201d** \u2013 \u201cPart 8\u201d is getting all the attention, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better episode in The Return than \u201cPart 17\u201d. It\u2019s the real conclusion of the season, with the various storylines converging in one intense, fascinating, and thoroughly Lynch-ian climax.\n\n**10. Master of None, \u201cThanksgiving\u201d** \u2013 Written by Lena Waithe, this wonderful episode beautifully chronicles a coming out story across several Thanksgiving dinners.\n\n**9. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, \u201cLate\u201d** \u2013 A harrowing performance by Alexis Bledel and a brutal hour of television.\n\n**8. Bojack Horseman, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow\u201d** \u2013 Yet another penultimate episode that helps solidify the show as both inventive and deeply human. It tackles dementia in an honest yet unflinching manner, providing clarity as it marches through time. The final moments are marked by kindness, heartbreak, and an embrace of the show\u2019s rich characters and history.\n\n**7. Better Things, \u201cEulogy\u201d** \u2013 Has a structure that sounds interesting but has the potential to fail on screen. Thankfully, it goes above and beyond, reaching emotional heights through an exploration of family.\n\n**6. Black Mirror, \u201cHang the DJ\u201d** \u2013 I think this is far and away the best episode of the new season, and one of the best episodes of the series. Georgina Campbell and Joe Cole are so, so good, and a unique concept provides fertile ground for an examination of relationships. But the driving force is its beating heart, paving the way for one hell of an ending.\n\n**5. Halt and Catch Fire, \u201cGoodwill\u201d** \u2013 \u201cI lost a really good friend, and I don\u2019t have many of those to spare.\u201d A masterful portrayal of grief, and that\u2019s all that really needs to be said.\n\n**4. The Leftovers, \u201cCertified\u201d** \u2013 Brenneman takes the spotlight here in a gorgeous but heavy episode. There\u2019s a scene atop a hill that\u2019s among the very best scenes of the show.\n\n**3. Nathan For You, \u201cFinding Frances\u201d** \u2013 A life-affirming documentary that turns the series in on itself, its introspective nature serving to enrich not only the comedy, but also the flashes of humanity that endure long after the camera is turned off.\n\n**2. Better Call Saul, \u201cChicanery\u201d** \u2013 Goddamn, this is a new height reached for the series and is truly television drama at its finest. It ends with a sequence so nail-biting and so well shot and acted that you\u2019re left marveling at the sheer creative talent on display.\n\n**1. Review, \u201cCryogenics, Lightning, Not Reviewing\u201d** \u2013 The third year in a row that my top episode of the year is from a comedy, but this final episode could not be further from a comedy. It pulls off the darkest and most brilliant twist of the year, one befitting the series in as perfect a manner as one could ever hope for. A masterpiece of an episode and one of the greatest series finales of all time.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**: \u201cThe Spoils of War\u201d (Game of Thrones), \u201cMarionettes\u201d (The Crown), \u201cDyatkovo\u201d (The Americans), \u201cMichael\u2019s Gambit\u201d (The Good Place), \u201cAu Reservoir\u201d (The Deuce)\n\nFeel free to express disagreements or list your own favorites. Always looking to see what others like. I wish I had the time to watch all the television that's on right now, but alas.",

The final moments are marked by kindness, heartbreak, and an embrace of the show\u2019s rich characters and history.\n\nThis was a fantastic episode that afterwards made me shut off Netflix and walk away. I'd argue that \"Stupid Piece of Sh*t\" was better, because an honest, real representation of living with depression and anxiety is something I've seen less often in media than dementia. Pretty subjective though; I'm biased because it hit me personally more than \"Time's Arrow\" did.",

But lets me debate this a bit. \ud83d\ude00\n\n> **Pamela Adlon, \u201cBetter Things\u201d**\n\nHannah Alligood's (Max) performance was more commendable in my opinion. She really stood out this season. And Pamela.... she's still Pamela. Californication, Louie, Better Things, it doesn't matter she always give good performances. \n\n> **Katherine Langford, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d**\n\nThought you'd forget about her for a sec there lol. And judging from your list I'm glad we both agree actresses stood out more than actors in 2017.... like, what happened to the men!? \ud83e\udd14\n\nThe rest of that list is pretty fantastic. Though I'd put Sarah Gadon higher, and add Reeses Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley from Big Little Lies as well. Also Alice Englert (Top of the Lake: China Girl) and Jessica Barden (The End of the Fucking World) gave commendable performances but I'm not sure if you've seen those.\n\n> **Twin Peaks: The Return, \u201cPart 17\u201d**\n\nInteresting choice... I would've gone with 'Part 8' or 'Part 18'. That fight scene in 17 was too absurd for my taste lol.\n\n>  **The Leftovers, \u201cCertified\u201d**\n\nAnother interesting choice. I didn't even remember this episode. for me, 'G'day Melbourne' all the way! \n\nNice 'best episodes' list but my favourite episodes besides 'Hang the DJ', 'eps3.5_kill-pr0cess.inc' and 'Late' aren't on here. \ud83d\ude22",

Haven't seen End of the fucking World yet.\n\n-Fair enough on Twin Peaks, I don't expect many people to choose 17 over 8 or 18. \n\n-Yeah, Sarah should probably be higher now that I think about it.\n\n-I mainly remember \"certified\" because of the goodbye scene between Matt, Laurie, and Nora. Absolutely beautiful.\n\n-What were your other favorite episodes?",
