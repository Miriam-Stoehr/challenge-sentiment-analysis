Those big moments, like when she beats Borgov or when she's getting help from her friends back in the US during that game, I think are written too dryly. There's not enough emotion captured in those moments, nor are they savoured. They just end ubruptly. Then there are times when she's truly enamoured or immersed in the moment, like when she falls in love with chess and talks about it so poetically towards the start of the book, does it feel like I'm reading a beautifully written story and not a news article. \n\nAll that being said, I don't hate the book, but I would rewatch the show more often than reread the book.",

For example, the queen's gambit always starts as your queen's pawn moving two squares out, your opponent's queen's pawn moving two squares, and then your queen's knight pawn moving two squares out. This is a good library of openings and book moves: [https://www.chess.com/openings](https://www.chess.com/openings)\n\nGreat: Great moves are ones that alter the course of the game in your favor, and are sometimes harder to find than good moves.\n\nGood: Good moves are decent moves, but not really the best you could have made in that position.\n\nInaccuracies: Inaccuracies are weak moves, like ones that leave you vulnerable to future attacks.\n\nMistakes: Mistakes give you a worse position immediately, giving the other player the advantage.\n\nBlunders: Blunders are pretty much the worst moves you can make, like sacrificing a valuable piece without reason or leads to an inevitable checkmate.\n\nMissed win: Missed wins are basically what they sound like; you had an opportunity to checkmate/play moves that lead to your eventual checkmate, and you didn't play them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you like chess, try looking at [chess.com](https://chess.com)!

                "comment_text": "If you wanted to write a paper, I would rank the episodes in importance this way- \n1. Episode One\n2. Episodes six and seven tie \n3. Episode four and five tie \n4. Episode two and three tie\n\nHere\u2019s why- \n1. Episode one sets up the basis for addiction, would be great for the first main point of your paper- the seeds of addiction can be sown young. Beth\u2019s trauma from her mothers death, her ignorance about the true addictive nature of the pills (and what other commenter said about laws) informs the seeds of addiction; most people who are addicts don\u2019t jump down the rabbit hole fast of substance abuse, but have a foot in the door to future addiction which can be a slippery slope.\n\n2. Episodes 6 and 7 are the second most important ones to watch because they set up a good third point for your paper, as well as a possible paper conclusion. If you only use episode 1 for your paper, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough for a full paper there. With episode 6 and 7, you can prove how addiction in adolescence wreaks havoc into adult life if not properly handled, and how addiction rears its head when life gets incredibly stressful. First half of episode 6 is where Beth is sober, it\u2019s useful for a conclusion (explained down below), but in the second half she spirals after her night out in Paris. Good examples for a paper would be beltik checking up on her and how addiction pushes away those who love you and that nobody can make an addict get help but themselves, and meeting Annette her first opponent (who looks up to Beth as a prodigy, but meanwhile Beth knows the truth about how sad her addictive state is). \n\nYou could conclude your essay with a hopeful note, the first half of episode 6 and the second half of 7 are useful for this! Benny and Jolene, helping her with sobriety, showing her that you can succeed without substances and the importance of a social support network that understands and empathizes with what an addict is going through. \n\n3. Episodes 4 and 5 could be the second big point of your paper. 4 is useful for 2 things, first is pointing out how substance use can seem casual and fun (the party with the stoners from russian class) and second, substance use can be familial as Beth\u2019s adoptive mom passes away from addiction and passes on the trauma to her, and Beth orders a Gibson drink in her mothers honor. 5 is important since that\u2019s where she spirals the most after her mothers death. Important examples include first, the instance where beltik says he\u2019s worried for her usage and compares her to \u201cthe pride and sorrow of chess\u201d, who died early and went mad, and second, when she runs into Margaret her bully from high school (who\u2019s now an alcoholic too) to show addiction is much more rampant in society and can be hidden. \n \n4. If you need more examples to bulk up your paper of how addiction starts young and reinforces itself, use these episodes, but they\u2019re not crucial to your main argument. Episode 2, only drug point is Beth steals her moms tranquilizers, and 3 Beth steals gin from the social club girls- showing how those addicted will lie to their loved ones and acquaintances to further their substance abuse, and how the entryway to addiction can start from everyday common scenarios that aren\u2019t dangerous or destructive. \n\nSorry if I wrote too much or seemed like I wanted to dictate your paper- I just used to really love writing essays on this stuff, so feel free to use my essay structure (episode 1 for your first point, episodes 4 and 5 for your second, and 6 and 7 for your third! Episodes 2 and 3, you only really need to cite those two small instances and don\u2019t need to rewatch for your paper) or message me for anything else!",

She was obviously very infatuated with him, which we knew from context clues and her saying so to Chloe. \n\nWe learn in the last episode that all he really wanted was a friend. He wanted a friend from the 15ish year old girl he met at a chess tournament? And then several years later lures her to his hotel room to be a friend? And then several years later spontaneously goes on a trip to Russia to be her friend? \n\nThe math ain\u2019t mathing. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, it feels like a PC move to make him gay. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dangle this potential romance for you romance lovers for the entirety of the series, but just kidding!\u201d",

None of the romances go anywhere concrete, which makes them feel a bit meaningless. Not that all of them needed to go somewhere, but at least one of them would have been nice. \n\nI think it would have made more sense if they kept Benny as the main romance like the novel. Just have Beth say, \"Benny...\" when asked who she loves, and have Benny show up in Russia to support her instead of Townes in the finale.",

Neither was well off, and like the widow's mite, they gave what little they had because they cared about her. As Jolene said, they're family. \n\nThen, when Townes gathers a 'team' for her (like the Russians play as a team) it's again because people care; people who show up for her in difficult times. That sort of love - the kind that sticks around even when she pushes them away - is what helps her see her own value, not just as a chess master, but as a person worthy of being loved.\n\nThe 'romance' is her loving herself, finally. Not in an ego driven way, but in a way that allows her to connect to other people, even the old man in the park who invites her to play right before the credits roll. Beth can walk in the world without her armor.",

And yet, the psychological struggle wasn\u2019t her entire identity. She was very strong in her convictions. She wasn\u2019t going to be used or be fake. She wasn\u2019t going to be cruel to others if she could help it. I applaud the writers for not allowing any one relationship distract from her story\u2014indeed, in the end it is all the friends as a conglomerate that help her, rather than just one.",

But the pinnacle of her inability to bond is Beth bonding with Beth: she can\u2019t reconcile all of her different versions and trains of thought, because at heart she\u2019s the same confused Beth she was when she entered the school 2 hours after losing her mother. Beth never really processes things completely, she plays them out on the board, so when Beth is hurt or lost or confused and the glass starts to crack, she\u2019d rather feel high and numb than having to face the Beth shaped void in the mirror that is filled with feelings, thoughts and needs she mutes out with chess and pills.",

In the actual position, she played h5 (which is the mistake Benny was referring to), and it is a slight inaccuracy.\n\nThe idea of c4 is that it disconnects the knight on b3 from the defending queen on g8, forcing it to retreat to avoid being captured by the queen. The idea isn't simply to kick the knight, there's a few different ideas after the knight is kicked away, but it is a winning move that leads to a very strong queenside attack.\n\nThe other problem is that if white doesn't play c4, black can actually just capture on c3 and create counterplay, which would've resulted in a tough position, but in the show, Beltik instead plays c5, which allows Beth to retain her advantage. It's a complex position, but you can probably find the full game somewhere and analyse it yourself, it's quite interesting\n\nAlso, just to clarify, it's not winning for black even if Beltik finds the best moves, it just makes the situation more complicated. White still has an edge even if Beltik found the right move, which he didn't.",

And if you like it, as I'm sure you will, try a few of Walter Tevis's other novels.\n\nThe novel is quite close to the miniseries, even down to a lot of the dialogue. All the characters in the miniseries are also characters in the book, even if some plot points are changed. The descriptions of the games at the climax in Russia are transposed in the miniseries into the words of the announcer. All in all, the novel is extremely satisfying, especially in regard to the Beth-Borgov relationship. That man is terrifying.\n\nThe Hustler and The Color of Money both follow a similar plot progression. If you liked Queens Gambit, you'll probably like those too.\n\nHis science fiction is great also. The Man Who Fell to Earth, of course. But it is a lesser known dystopian, post-apocalyptic novel, Mockingbird, that I think is his best.\n\nI'm now reading a book of his science fiction short stories, Far from Home. It's very unusual and doesn't fit into normal sci-fi tropes. The narrator's parents come back from the dead to visit and show what they were like as young people. Walter Tevis obviously lived in New York and had a lot of psychotherapy.\n\nBut start with Queens Gambit if you haven't read it. It will satisfy your Beth Harmon jones.",

Thousands?\"\n\nYou can just feel the reaction of her mother, abandoned by her husband and wondering how she will make ends meet. And then the next scene has her mother with the copy of Chess Review planning out the next tournament in Cincinnati.\n\nThis sequence was not in the book. But it was in the miniseries. I like how they made an explicit connection between Beth's triumph and her mother's response, grasping at a lifeline to a new possibility of supporting herself. In the book, the connection was implied; in the miniseries, it was explicit. Happy that the screenwriters made it explicit.",

I may be misremembering these, since it's been a while since I've watched the miniseries, so please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1. Jolene bailed out Beth when she lacked funds to go to Russia in the miniseries, but not in the book.\n\n2. The San Francisco tournament prior to going to Russia, after Jolene had helped Beth rehabilitate herself, occurred in the book but not the miniseries. Cut for length, I imagine.\n\n3. In the book, Beth forfeited a game at the Kentucky state championships when she was in danger of losing to an insignificant local player. Don't think this happened in the miniseries. I think she just dropped out.\n\n4. The reunion with Annette Packer at the Kentucky state championships occurred in the miniseries but not the book. Same with the conversation/confrontation with Harry Beltik at the same event.\n\n5. In the miniseries, Townes was clearly gay. In the book, he was not. (Or if he was, there was no indication.)\n\n6. How did Beth find Jolene, her savior? In the book, she called Helen Deardoff at Methuen. In the miniseries, I think Jolene just magically showed up.\n\n7. In the miniseries, when Benny Watts called Beth in Russia, one of the members on the Beth team was Harry Beltik. Not in the book. (Appropriately, in my view. I guess they thought they needed some kind of reconciliation between Harry and Beth.)\n\n8. Townes showed up at the Russian tournament in the miniseries, but not in the book.\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment, and as I said, I may have some of these wrong, so please correct me if that's the case. And if you can add to this list, please do.\n\nI do agree with you that the scriptwriters had an easy job. They simply copied what Tevis wrote for the most part. But a lot of the appeal of the series was in the casting and costuming and sets, so I wouldn't belittle the producers. It was a magnificent production, as evidenced by this Reddit forum devoted to it..",

        "text": "In terms of its structure, Queen's Gambit is a sports movie. And I want to make the argument that the sports movie it most resembles is Rocky IV: Beth is Rocky, Borgov is Ivan Drago, and Benny Watts is Adrianne.\n\nSports movies have an arc in which the stakes and action rise towards a climactic 'championship game.' The protagonist suffers a series of setbacks. The opponent is built up as unbeatable. A secondary character (usually a love interest) abandons the protagonist, who must face the big game alone, and then has a change of heart and swoops in to provide last-minute support. Against all odds, the protagonist wins the big game.\n\nAll of these elements are present in both Queen's Gambit and Rocky IV.\n\n - Borgov is steely, remote, emotionless and terrifying; Drago the same, more machine than man.\n\n- Beth withdraws into alcohol and pills; Rocky withdraws to a remote cabin where he has to train by pulling logs through the snow. (This is the weakest of the parallels, since Rocky can't be shown to use alcohol and pills.)\n\n- Benny Watts tells Beth to get lost, then calls during the final match to plot strategy; Adrianne is furious at Rocky for going to Russia, then has a change of heart and shows up in Moscow to cheer Rocky on. Both Beth and Rocky face the final match with new vigor thanks to the return of and support from their love interests.\n\nBut the area in which I think two movies are most alike is in how the Soviet Union is portrayed.\n\nChess is a religion in Russia and the matches are played in a (much classier) version of Caesar's Palace, with a huge crowd inside and a bigger crowd outside. It's essentially a Colosseum in which foreign chess players are fed to the lions.\n\nIn Rocky IV, the prestige of the Soviets is on the line. Drago is able to train using equipment that is so high tech, and anabolic steroids that are so effective, that it puts US training methods to shame. And the match is played in an enormous hall with the premier and entire Politburo watching.\n\nWhen Beth wins, she also wins the hearts of the Russian people (especially the women, if you look at the people who wait outside to applaud and ask for autographs). When Rocky wins, the Russians in the crowd are also won over.\n\nIs this a stretch? Does anyone or disagree? Queen's Gambit is definitely a sports movie (just like Die Hard is a Christmas movie). The more controversial part is that the relevant comparison is to Rocky IV.\n\n(Yes, Rocky IV is a terrible movie, while Queen's Gambit is genius, but in terms of structure and the buildup of the Soviet Union they are quite similar.)\n\nThe two movies are alike not only because of the championship game aspect, but because the Soviet Union is built up as an empire that can't be defeated, yet is.",

We certainly saw that with Beth in Queens Gambit. Not so much in Rocky IV, as there's not a lot of subtlety to the Rocky character.\n\nIn terms of the sympathy for the Soviets in the Cold War, the 40-year gap between the two stories really comes through. In the 1980s, it might have been somewhat plausible that the Russians had all of the advanced training techniques used to create Ivan Drago. The  portrayal of the Soviets in Queens Gambit is almost nostalgic, a high point in what we now know was a soon to be shattered empire.\n\nI've read that Queens Gambit was quite popular in Russia, and one of the things they liked about it was the sympathy with which the Russians were portrayed.\n\nI'm wondering when Tevis wrote the book. If he wrote it in the 1980s, he certainly had great empathy for chess in the Soviet Union. Of course he was a chess player himself, so I suppose that's not surprising.",

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRdgGBJWrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRdgGBJWrw) (Jovi Houska 2023Mar)\n\nSomeone said [Wesley So](https://www.reddit.com/xcdhgq) is the [most inconsistent player](https://imgur.com/a/nfTlh3y) in terms of tournament results. I think it's consistent that [Wesley So](https://reddit.com/wvtrhm)'s been performing so-so in the 3 events between the [2022 Olympiad](https://reddit.com/whnrj6) and the 2022 chessc\\*m [global championship](https://reddit.com/yrhl72) & [2022 meltwater finals](https://reddit.com/z1tj1m), namely\n\n1. [St Louis' Chess9LX](https://reddit.com/xd64d7)\n2. [US Chess Championship](https://uschesschamps.com/2022-us-championships/2022-us-championship) (USCC) and\n3. FIDE World [Fischer Random](https://reddit.com/ybzz7f) Chess '[Championship](https://www.reddit.com/ydwn2y)' (WFRCC),\n\ndespite having been\n\n1. [2nd place in 9LX 2021](https://reddit.com/yc2b5y)\n2. then-reigning and 3-time USCC [and](https://reddit.com/ybrhqj)\n3. Inaugural and then-reigning [WFRCC](https://reddit.com/ybs5li)\n\nThe reason is that [Wesley So](https://reddit.com/x9vwrn) started a secret relationship with 2021 women's [US](https://www.reddit.com/yev3a1)CC Carissa Yip at the Olympiad.\n\n# My basis:\n\nA. These events at the Olympiad:\n\n1. Look at [Carissa](https://twitter.com/carissayipchess)'s Twitter [header](https://reddit.com/xr2bhp). It's a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/qsq5WBE) of just Wesley and Carissa (and Leinier Dom\u00ednguez P\u00e9rez and 1 other).\n2. You can see [Levon Aronian was being Wesley's wingman](https://www.reddit.com/comments/wiij1k/_/iom381y/) when they were teasing Carissa about castling (which is [pretty ironic given what happened later to Wesley](https://reddit.com/yenuil) in the WFRCC, but well I guess it goes to show [how little preparation](https://www.reddit.com/x49iac) Wesley did for the [2019 WFRCC](https://reddit.com/rkhavt)... Anyway...). You can see Levon even makes a 'mistake' in saying that when you castle, the king goes 2 squares, which allows Wesley to say 'unless it's chess960' to flex being the inaugural and then-reigning WFRCC.\n   1. ([Levon also probably has a soft spot for Wesley because Arianne Caoili](https://twitter.com/nicbentulan/status/1469280107386703872/likes), Levon's deceased spouse, was Filipina. RIP.)\n   2. ([Btw, Wesley is still the WFRCC. Hikaru is just the rapid WFRCC. Wesley never lost the title to Hikaru kinda like how Bobby Fischer never lost the title to Anatoly Karpov.](https://www.reddit.com/comments/ym5ogj/_/iv20l6z/))\n3. There's a [Tagalog interview with FM Deniel Causo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vylMndunCa8) where Wesley was asked about romantic relationships, namely if Wesley has a 'special someone'. (Btw, Tagalog interviews of Wesley are pretty rare, so for me I think they're pretty important.) It was probably this interview that gave Wesley a wake up call to finally start a relationship with Carissa.\n\nB. And later in the USCC\n\n* Wesley talks about [how teenagers always play for a win](https://reddit.com/xzdmr5) because they don't have family, bills or GIRLFRIENDS. Wesley laughs at the girlfriends part.\n\nC. Someone [pointed](https://imgur.com/a/nfTlh3y) out to me that at [33:33 of the 2021 USCC closing ceremony Carissa admits to being star struck by Wesley (and Fabi). Take a look at Wesley's reaction to that. Lol. Additionally, look at how Naz\u00ed Paikidze reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBTt8RezzM4). Naz\u00ed probably knew about Carissa's crush on Wesley and was being a wingwoman for Carissa by noting Wesley's reaction to later tell Carissa.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8p5lvp9lig4b1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bba4474b7e50d346a2f9e41cb9fb080274efc9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yep109rmig4b1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5843fe00b116ec49f64c71ba1eecf46f783faa8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3yh7ktnig4b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e5a07d939eccf46e06f516421e094d601a8b289\n\n# So what I guess is:\n\nD. At the Olympiad, they got together, but, because of their 1 decade age gap, they decided to keep their relationship a secret.\n\n* 5 years from now, when Carissa will have graduated from Stanford, their ages 19&29 will become 24&34, the minimum age when the [half your age plus 7 rule is satisfied](https://reddit.com/wf0pkg).\n\nE. But still, since it was both of their 1st times dating, they were very distracted eg talking on the phone all night.\n\n* Notice that Wesley hasn't made any Facebook posts between [the start of the Olympiad](https://www.facebook.com/wesleyso/posts/pfbid02ax1LQcavVUqH4KR9quoQxsqRwW1ZkuaxpsrhnEPYaZetsMxzYuUw19RAKVtD4ECbl) and [the end of the CGC](https://www.facebook.com/wesleyso/posts/pfbid02HxbzoBFZezqGfLckYwejjS2UZjce2eLy6XJHReoK5PLkiEVhfEFpz6LqLy6Qr6Zgl). I guess this is because the time Wesley would've used for Facebook went to talking to Carissa.\n\nF. Anyway, we don't see much of an impact, if any, on Carissa because Carissa stopped playing chess for awhile, in particular didn't defend at the 2022 women's USCC for studies at [Stanford](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/07/07/carissa-yip-woman-chess-player-special/7828795001/). But, well, we did see much impact on Wesley in placing only\n\n1. 5th out of 10 in 9LX,\n2. 6th of 14 in USCC and\n3. 6th of 8 in WFRCC\n\nThe WFRCC underperformance was the last straw. It was like the [Beth and Cleo thing in The Queen's Gambit](https://the-queens-gambit.fandom.com/wiki/Adjournment). Wesley and Carissa decided to slow down their relationship. And then voil\u00e0 Wesley wins $200,000 in the CGC and can now fully celebrate with Carissa. (I'd argue it wasn't really an '[underperformance](https://www.reddit.com/ydwn2y)' but that maybe Wesley isn't so good at 25min 9LX compared to the original 45min 9LX. Also, Wesley was likely NOT underperforming *outside* of chess. Lol.)\n\nG. After Meltwater finals, I bet Wesley and Carissa are celebrating a lot more.\n\nH. Finally, Wesley said in an interview with Dina Belenkaya during the FIDE Grand Prix ('[I am not afraid of Hikaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI6xuDHn68)') that Wesley's mom, Lotis Key, didn't want Wesley to use Twitter.\n\n* Who else but Carissa (your new girlfriend/romantic partner) could've convinced Wesley (yourself) to defy [Lotis](https://reddit.com/tz4fxw) (your mom/parent - not [bio mom](https://reddit.com/z9u9ts) though) ?\n\n\\---\n\n**inb4**: 'This might be the oddest obsession i've seen' - [fgdadfgfdgadf](https://reddit.com/comments/j1qp0e/_/g729pze/) re TehTex's [removed comment](https://reddit.com/rwmtsq) about [Wesley and Alireza](https://reddit.com/xf1b1j).\n\n\\---\n\n# Some feedback: [see images in wordpress]\n\n1.

(SPOILER AHEAD)\n\n\nIn the novel there is at least one very big difference in Beth\u2019s scene with Jolene after her fall from grace into a drunken mess. In the show, Jolene magically deus ex machina\u2019s herself onto Beth\u2019s doorstep. In the novel, Beth seeks out Jolene. She calls the orphanage and begs the headmistress for Jolene\u2019s phone number so she can call her. This shows the difference in the morals of the two works. If you suffer from addiction, depression, the NOVEL says that the first step to getting better is seeking help. You cannot hope that someone will magically show up on your doorstep and fix all your problems because life doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to actively search for help and make an effort to improve first. In the SHOW, the solution IS to wait for someone to magically show up at your doorstep. Do not worry about your addiction because someone will come and help solve all your problems. \nI see this as the major moral flaw of the adaptation. There are more examples highlighting this but I believe this one best illustrates my point.",

It lead to way too many suspicions that she's a KGB plant to distract Beth and I thought the notion of \"she didn't beat Borgov because of her hangover. *If only* she stayed sober...\" had so much less impact than how it went down in the book. Yes, they rectify it with a line when she talks to Benny, but still, the impression is there.\n\nOn the other hand, one aspect I do like about it is, that Beth is portrayed more like an addict in this instance. In the book, it felt to me more like she can turn the addiction (or at least the excesses) on and off at will.\n\nAnd I agree that Jolene \"magically\" turning up cheapens Beths overcoming her problem a lot. If your focus is on that, then I can start to \"fathom\". For me, the focus of the show was more about Beths inability to connect with other people on more than a surface level. (One thing that *I* can relate to much more than drug addiction. Maybe that's the reason I see it different from you)\n\nI think the focus of the finale was for Beth to learn, accept and embrace, that people really do care about her. Jolene, Mr. Shaibel, even the drug store owner, and especially Beltik and Watts & Co.\n\nI think this is also part of the \"meaning\" of the book. I did not read TQG as \"prodigy overcomes addiction\" but as \"troubled soul finds its way in life\", with all the \"accepting yourself\", \"accepting others\", \"accepting others accepting you\" that comes with it. So again, for me, the show didn't botch the meaning, it just shifted the focus.",

                "comment_text": "Oh yeah, the Cleo section. Honestly, I found her so forgettable and pointless to the show that I didn\u2019t even realize she doesn\u2019t exist in the book. XD\n\nAs for the show portraying Beth as an addict more clearly than the book, this is true. But I would disagree that she was able to \u201cturn the addiction on or off at will\u201d. I believe the book does an excellent job highlighting her drug use and foreshadowing her overcoming her addiction, especially in relation to Beth\u2019s chess ability. We\u2019re shown in the show from the very beginning that Beth struggles to win without drugs from a very young age. Of course she has talent - immense talent at that - but during her lessons with Mr. Shaibel, the simul at the school,  and her match against Beltik she uses drugs to help her win. In fact, I would say in the show she would have lost against Beltik without the aid of her drugs. This leads to two assumptions from the audience: 1) Beth may be talented, but she needs drugs to be able to focus and win and 2) Beth shows no ability thus far to possibly overcome her addiction (with relation to using drugs for chess). In the book, another key difference is that Beth does NOT use drugs to beat Beltik, proving to the reader the opposite of the show: 1) Beth\u2019s chess skill is not tied to her drug use and 2) She does not have to rely on drugs and has the strength to win without them. \n\nThis makes much more sense for the scene later in the book where Beth seeks out Jolene, it is a logical follow-through about what we know of her character. Similarly, this is why the show needed Jolene to deus ex machina herself on Beth\u2019s doorstep, because TV Beth DIDN\u2019T have the strength to seek out help. But the biggest problem in the show (I think) was that it doesn\u2019t show that Beth herself believes she has any ability to win without her drugs. She may SAY that she\u2019s better than her opponents, but her actions show that when she faces tough opponents such as Benny and Borgov, she struggles and loses without drugs. The one truly difficult match she wins without drugs is against Benny, but by then I would argue it is too late for establishing Beth true ability.\n\nAs for the focus of the show, I understand that part of Beth\u2019s struggles is her inability to deeply connect with other people. But I think that her struggle is tied directly to her addictions. Her addictions being drugs, alcohol, chess, and even her ego. \n\nOn a surface level, it is clear Beth is addicted to alcohol and drugs. The alcohol helps her feel good when she\u2019s sad and the drugs help her focus during chess. \n\nThe less clear but still noticeable addiction is chess. While playing chess is not inherently a bad thing, I would be remiss if I did not bring up Paul Morphy\u2019s famous quote: \u201cThe ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life\u201d. An important warning by one of the best chess players of all time that devoting one\u2019s life to being the best at any single thing will force you to miss out and sacrifice many other great parts of life. \n\nBut the most important addiction I believe Beth suffers from is her tying her self-worth to her chess ability. It is a precarious thing, tying one\u2019s self-worth to an ability or skill, because the world is a vast place and you might risk losing yourself and your reason for existing if you meet others better than you. Beth\u2019s entire existence from a very young age had been centered around chess. Her loss against Borgov crushes her and leads her to a downward spiral where she all but gives up on chess. Perhaps the show\u2019s main focus was meant to be her overcoming her addiction, with the deeper meaning being related to a universal struggle people go through when they lose their reason for existing or question their entire worldview.\n\nBut if it was not and it was about Beth accepting herself, others, and others\u2019s acception, how did the show portray that well? Beth had a good relationship with Mr. Shaibel and clearly cared for him even after his death. She willingly got close to Benny and let him help her. She even grew closer with Beltik when he came and she willingly accepted his help. And she readily accepted Jolene\u2019s help. Beth (in the show) never asked for help, she was simply offered it and accepted it.  I don\u2019t think Beth struggled with accepting herself or others\u2019s care or anything of the like. I believe she struggled with accepting her own flaws. And I believe this struggle came from the drug addiction that led her to overestimate her abilities from a young age. It\u2019s very difficult to believe that she: had the skills to win on her own when she relied on drugs to beat even someone easy like Beltik, could overcome her drug addiction even with the help of others, or that she had trouble accepting help from others.\n\nI still think the theme of both stories is about addiction, physical vices and an attachment to one\u2019s sense of self, and learning to have the strength to give up those vices and be willing to grow as a person.\n\nWith that said, what do you think?",

She seemed to hold a lot of grudges and didn\u2019t get along with people that well. \n\nThere were a lot of great scenes. One for me was when Beth says to Luchenko that it was an honor to play him and he goes \u201cAll this, it\u2019s not like chess at all\u201d and she smiles \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d \n\nBut my favorite scene was when she was in bed in Benny\u2019s apartment, and she was thinking about a beautiful queen promotion strategy while ignoring a couple outside hurling horrible insults at each other. I took it to mean that in this ugly world of pettiness, misogyny, and conflict, at least Beth had something infinite, beautiful, and transcendental to devote herself to: the game of chess. \n\nSorry for the essay, just thought the story was masterful and needed to vent lol",

The description continues: \"This beautiful board is the same one used in the 1968 final of the Tournament of Champions held in Moscow where protagonist Beth Harmon defeats Russian chess champion Vasily Borgov.\"\n\nI had a good laugh. As all fans of \"The Queen's Gambit\" should know by now, the boards used for the scenes of the Moscow tournament were new ones, made by Rechapados Ferrer. Apart from that the whole story of course is entirely fictional. I'm still not sure whether the seller was trying to dupe someone naive enough to not see through this madness, or if he intended it as a joke. \ud83d\udcf7 Maybe not, because I confronted the seller after the board had been sent, and he sort of pretended that he wasn't in on the joke.\n\nAnyway, I liked the style of the board enough, and the end price was right, so I won the auction. A real board made by a fictitious company for a fictitious tournament in a fictional TV show - irresistible. I also knew the craftsmanship was a bit on the rough side, but I bought it for the fun of it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtkh1f1w3z791.jpg?width=3227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44660c0138c2455a33c5f161bc6dd6b16b73a715\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vp6qef1w3z791.jpg?width=3970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18eaa8bd86f5f212d111a99b116bdd0b587c95cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/260obb1w3z791.jpg?width=3710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0160fc32e59a3a23ab81a14b99442e69e86b3dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1efeyc1w3z791.jpg?width=3020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=842b71fd21fa9d624b00e77d76cb18984c434c65\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8jkhz1w3z791.jpg?width=3665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddadd131c73bb1316c774aee1b13accfb8702c97\n\nYep, it really comes with a massive \"HARMON\" sign attached to the back. I also think I've seen that logo before, possibly in connection with the character/show. I'm sure one or more copyright infringements are involved here, too, but let's not go into those right now.\u00a0\n\nTo the seller's credit, his original photos didn't gloss over the rough edges in the workmanship. The board isn't made of individual chunks of wood; rather, what they did was laminate each square independently onto a single massive wood or MDF \"plank\". The board is quite heavy (about 5-6kg on a 46cm x 46cm board with 50mm squares).\n\nI'll never know for sure. I'll probably also never find out who actually makes these boards, and I haven't seen one in this exact style before. Have you? I don't think it's mass-produced, maybe it's made by an enthusiast.\n\nBe that as it may, I think this is a real curiosity item, and since I bought it knowing fully well about its dubious \"credentials\", I am more amused than infuriated with its existence, especially as a huge fan of the show. Still, I am pretty confident the seller didn't really believe someone could be THAT ignorant to believe the fairy tale story around it.",

        "text": "I was confused about few things after watching the series and want to share my thoughts with other people, who else read the book.   \n \n\n1. From the 1st minutes: waking up in a bath, hotel room full of cigarettes butts, alcohol and then rushing to play chess tournament, really? This scene is not realistic, nor taken from the book. I think it was made this way just to capture the viewer's attention, let's present an eccentric character (lives a cool lifestyle, cool looking and doesn't care that everyone waits for her). That's precise description of Beth, right?\n2. Show Beth is so aggressive: she pushed the girls when \"apple pie\" girls were marching trough corridor; she called Mr. Shaibel \"cocksucker\" after loosing; she was so bitter and snide while playing vs Beltik. \n3. Show doesn't explain why she uses the tranquilisers, it doesn't explain her relationship with them. In the show \"pills\" are drugs, she tried them and got addicted. Why? Because these are drugs and everyone gets addicted to them, end of story. While in the book, the author describes her insecurities, how she felt uncomfortable in the new place, she could not sleep, she was literally staring at the celling all night. She was saving the pills for the night because it was the only way for her to \"get rid of that tension in her tommy\", relax and sleep.\n4. I am confused about the deviation from the book:  \n\\- Why did they introduced mother's past? Made her a doctor in math? Decided that mother should suicide - \"close your eyes\"...  \n\\- Added more \"artistic flavor\" to Mrs Wheatley - made her a pianist. To give her a valid reason to stay home all day?  \n\\- What was the point to lie about her age (when she was adopted)?  \n\\- Removed the sexual scene with Jolene. Mrs Deardorff was helping Beth. Why? To make this characters \"likeable\", even if it doesn't fit them?\n\nI am not against adapting books and making movies, but it feels uncomfortable to watch the show called \"The Queen's Gambit\" suggesting it is from the book \"The Queen's Gambit\", yet they are so different. If instead, the show would be called something else or be \"inspired by the book\", I feel the author would have valid reasons to change the characters, as he pleases. Maybe my \"issue\" is that I read the book 1st, have successfully created the world in my head, and THEN saw the show. It surely looked different and also unrealistic. It feels very different and so distant. I read your comments, happy to know other people liked it, even people that read the book. In the show, the Beth is more of a \"pop\" style, easily winning against any opponent. Why? Because her mother has a book in math, because Beth is genius and because she takes pills. To make it better, they added a \"cowboy\" that spends nights by clubbing and play a bit of chess during the day. Does this make sense to you?",

The Queens Gambit is one of the most faithful translations of book material to film ever.\n\nThat said...\n\n1. Yes, I didn't like the whole change in Paris. In the book, Beth is fully sober by then and prepared and on top of her game and still Borgov wipes the floor with her. Imho a much more powerful sequence in the book. And you're right, the main reason is very likely to have an interesting start that hooks the viewers right away. It's sadly a sign of the times of oversupply. If a show doesn't catch the audience in the first five to ten minutes, most people will move on to something else.\n2. Yes, social anxiety expressed by animosity.\n3. Insecurity and umcomfortableness is much harder to show than tell. I got that from the show, too. And if it was *just* \"drugs make you addicted\", then why was it so easy for the other kids to quit? It was much harder for Beth exactly because she needed them much more.\n4.  \n\n* Fully agreed. Hated the trope of \"child of a mad genius is mad herself\". Not needed, Luckily only a very small part of the show.\n* Well, to give Mrs. Wheatly *some* character. The book does not give much about her.\n* When asked if ATJ could pull of a 13 year old, she said no. *Maybe* a 15 year old. But they wanted to get her to play the role as early as possible, so they \"cheated\". I'm fine with that.\n* You really think anyone would be mad enough to show a twelve year old raping an eight year old? Nope! Just nope! To leave this one out was probably the best decision they made.\n\nShe \"easily\" wins in the book, too, most of the time. She does not win in the show \"because\" of the pills (they just calm her down enough). And that cowboy was also a cowboy in the book.\n\nI'm sorry, that the world in your head is different from the show, but for a show, where most scenes start, play out and end exactly as described in the book, with dialog taken word by word and with set design matching the descriptions to the tip of a penis candle, I just can't agree with your assessment that this is not a very faithful adaptation.",

To me, the scene just strongly conveyed some very familiar feeling of \"oh fuck oh fuck I overslept I fucked up fuuuuck I'm late to the important thing!\". It immediately allowed me to relate to Beth, a character that I didn't know and that I have barely anything in common with. Empathizing with the character in turn made me interested in the questions \"Where is she going? What happened last night? How will she deal with whatever lies before her?\"\n\nThis is not to say that the series *had* to start out this way - I just wanted to provide my perspective in which the scene was kinda useful.",

Children are much less likely to be adopted the older they get, and at 15 children are almost always destined to age out and never become adopted. Back then, they'd just lie about their ages. Thus Deardorff lying-- as viewers, we eventually understand that Alma wouldn't have really cared, but most do.\n\nAnd I don't get how you think the first scene was meant to make her look \"cool and eccentric.\" I've never understood how people find substance abuse glamorous, but I got a very different picture of what was being conveyed. A very troubled girl who engages in such destruction right before a clearly important competition-- as viewers, this is kind of like \"now watch as we tell you how she got this point, and if she can redeem herself.\"\n\nEdit to add: Idk how anyone can possibly construe it as *her* being the rude one in that match. Beltik showed up carelessly late for no actual reason, was condescensing, yanwed loudly & dramatically through the beginning of the match, generally acted like she wasn't worth his time. Then he started acting temperamental and aggressive when he realized she was a worthy opponent.\n\nAnd it wasn't \"drugs make you addicted, end of story.\" None of the other children were addicted to them like she was. Even Jolene was sad to see that years later, Beth was still abusing them-- Jolene didn't end up addicted.\n\nMaking Alma a pianist isn't something that should upset people. It gives dimension to her character-- it also shows that she once had a passion & gift, too, but feels she wasn't able to live it: if you notice, she and Beth don't bond at all until she discovers Beth's gift of chess, and it changes their entire relationship. I personally love Alma's character and think they did great with it, from the writing to the casting.",

Not needed, Luckily only a very small part of the show.\n\nThat is a pretty reductionist way of viewing the premise of the show. It's not \"child of a mad genius is mad herself\", personally I even dislike the popular idea that genius=mad always and I think this show is also trying to convey that that idea is not true\\*. The premise of the show is mother who happens to be a genius and is having emotional and probably socio-economical struggles, leaves her child ,who is also a genius (and I don't think this idea is implausible given how intelligence is believed to be largely hereditary), orphaned and traumatized, and with her own set of personal and emotional problems to overcome. And that is what we see in the show. So I disagree with two things: 1. The premise of the show being reduced to a \"trope\" and 2. that it is not needed and a very small part of the show; in my opinion it is one of the most significant underlying themes given how much it affects everything that happens afterwards, Beth's character and worldview and therefore, her actions. \n\n\\*Beth isn't mad or an addict because she's gifted and that's what happens with gifted people, she's and addict because she has suffered a lot through life and that is how she initially learned to cope. If we compare the mother's life to Beth's, they are similar in that they are both gifted and they both have suffered traumatic things in their lives (we don't know much about what led the mother to do what she did so we can only speculate. The show doesn't say it was necessarily due to her 'genius', could have been other circumstances, her personality, etc.) But while her mother gave in to despair, Beth overcame her struggles, was able to form healthy bonds who became her support system, and overcame her addiction, while still being able to maintain her gift and accomplish her goals, showing that you can be a genius and also lead a healthy, fulfilling life.",

And with that gift, she \"sees\" what others can't. \n\nYou can get better and better by training harder and harder. But at some point you get diminishing returns.

I oppose theory that they could live all their life \"under the rock\" and then, out of nowhere, wright the theory of relativity. I agree, they are comfortable with numbers but is it because the galaxy \"shared\" something unique with them that did not share with anyone else?

She described in details her complaint about society perceiving women in a certain way and associating some professions with women, and what now? Having a \"compliant\" stance, also referred as a \"victim\" doesn't help, unless you are just looking for attention. I am pretty sure all of us can consider our current options and choose whats best. I am talking from my own experience so maybe it only worked \"in my world\".

                "comment_text": ">\"genius\" means very intelligent, no relation too \"gifted\"\n\nThat's a very very narrow definition. You can be a musical genius, that has no corellation with intelligence. When someone is seemingly effortlessly good at something, they are commonly refered to as \"something\" genius. (Btw. as far as I know, Einstein having trouble at school is a myth. He had a lot of sixes in his school report which would be the worst mark in germany, where a 6 corresponds to an F and a 1 to an A. But he went to a swiss school, where it's reversed and a 6 is an A and a 1 would be an F. So he did actually very good in school, but that misconception lead to that myth)\n\nOf course a genius still has to learn and study. They aren't born with some \"pre-programmed\" knowledge, but they have a much much easier time understanding, remembering and applying what they have learned.\n\nBeth studied chess hard. Beltik might have studied even harder than her, but her \"genius\" helped her get past Beltik with a lot less effort. And it helped her get beyond anything Beltik could ever hope to reach, even if he would dedicate his whole life to nothing but learning chess. And he knows that. That's why he stopped.\n\nLet's back up a little. You asked, why Alma was made to be a pianist. My argument was, that she does not have that much of a personality in the book (it's been a while since I read it. Correct me if I'm wrong), so they added something, that wasn't in the book, without contradicting the book and that fit into the time of the story. One of the essays point (imho) is, that the role of the woman was that of a housewife. It was unusual for them to have jobs and socially accepted hobbies were mainly artistic, like painting or music. In that way, the essay strengthens the shows decision to give Alma that hobby. And they used it to parallel Beth.\n\nAlma is very good. Had the chance to go professional, but was to scared. And now she lives her life (maybe unconciously?) regretting that decision. So when she sees Beths chance to \"go professional\", a part of why Alma helps Beth might stem from making up for that regret.\n\n\\--\n\nWhen you translate something from one medium to another, there are bound to be changes. In books, you often have \"internal monologues\", that would be strange in a movie (see Lynchs \"Dune\" for example). And that's just one aspekt. It takes hours to read a book, but in a movie, you usually have about two.\n\nSo there always wil be changes. The question is, how good or bad are those changes.\n\nIf you leave stuff out, it can be good, because it drags in the book, but it's usually bad, because it gives context. And if you add stuff, it can be bad, because it contradicts stuff in the book, but it can also be good, because it enhances the story, giving it more depth. You can change things to fix plot holes or make it work better in the new medium, or you can mess up and destroy what made the original source great.\n\nAdding Alma being a pianist is good or at least not bad imho. Changing the events in paris is bad (again imho). Adding Beths mother being a math genius (gone crazy/suicidal) is more on the bad chlich\u00e9 side for me. Adding/changing the line about the female russian chessmaster was probably the most stupidly unnecessary thing they did. Combining several people into the twins or Townes helped the show and the viewers. I'm relatively indifferent about Beth knowing russian in the show; I prefer the book. The scene in the orphanage *might* have been excusable by 1983 standards as \"exploring sexuality\" (which Beth later continues to do. On *her* terms), but as I already wrote, it was probably the best decision they made to leave it out in the show completely.\n\nSo the question with changes is always, how much do they really impact the story. And with The Queen's Gambit, the faithfullness by far outweighs all of the (rather minor) changes they did.",

I'm currently watching the show for the 2nd time and I obviously LOVE it, (like almost everyone else duh) even more this time. So, I'm curious, how much does the book resemble the show, and is it interesting to read? \nI'd say I have a pretty basic taste in books and movies (I usually like things everyone likes tbh), so what would you say, would the book appeal to a general audience like the TV show does?",

Also if you are a chess fan the book makes following the chess moves and decisions behind the moves easier.  The show does have those sweet graphics of the games on the ceiling but the book describes them.   Glad you enjoy the show as much as we do.",

It's true that you can find more about Beth's inner monologue, but the show is actually really loyal to the book, so you are not missing a thing. \nI personally felt while I was reading it that I couldn't relate with Beth as much as I did with her at the show. The narrative feels a bit cold, so I actually felt that I was reading a script, not a book. Maybe that was my mistake because I read it after watching the show, but honestly, I was expecting more about the book. \nAbout the scenes, as I've sed before, the show is really loyal todo the book, so there is only one scene that is not in the serie, and believe me, is better this way. \nThe book may be good for you if you are kind of into external narrators, but for me, it was a disappointment.",

I'm still writing my paper on The Queen's Gambit and I'm currently struggling with understanding Townes and what he is supposed to represent in the story. Specifically, what does he represent in both the novel and the Netflix adaptation? Townes plays vastly different roles in each work, to the point that he doesn't even show up after Beth's Las Vegas tournament. \n\nI'm sure Townes represents something more than just \"the pretty boy/crush\" in the book but I can't figure it out.

Gay sexual relations was literally illegal then.  Gays were certainly NOT accepted then.\n\nNow Townes said himself he was confused.  To me that meant Beth made him wonder \"wait - maybe I'm NOT gay??\"\n\nBeth \"broke his heart in that (I think) she seemed to be upset over realizing he was gay (the guy walking in was the only real indication)\n\nTownes wanted to be friends - very important to realize that in the 60s, a guy and girl (usually) were not platonic friends.  (I grew up in the 60s; guys generally only \"liked\" girls as a girlfriend material.  I always assumed girls felt similar.   And of course that idea was still VERY prevalent in the movie \"When Harry Met Sally\" in 1989\n\nIt took a LONG time before people accepted you can have strong feelings for someone of the opposite sex without actually wanting to HAVE sex with them.\n\nIt's THAT idea that I think Townes represents to me.  As a straight married male (father/grandfather) who over the years found good friendship with 3 different women over the past 40 plus years.\n\nNOTE - typed quickly and I may edit later\n\nI LOVED Queen's Gambit!\n\nFirst edit already -\n\nThis idea of guys/girls only as \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" is officially dead I believe.

There is only one scene I know of in which two characters both in white interact - the racketball game, and that, of course, is not Chess. The summer Beth and Harry spend together is particularly instructive here - watch it, and pay attention to who is wearing white or dark colors and how it affects their interactions. It includes one scene where Beth takes off a dark top to reveal a white shirt - and Harry in black, seemingly about to act, is set back. When Chloe phones up from the hotel lobby in Paris, Beth answers wearing white but comes down to the bar in dark red (the most common color of the dark pieces after black). She's gone from in control to following.\n\nThe other scene in which a character goes from black to white is the hotel scene with Townes. Watch Beth's reaction to him taking off his sweater. There's a lot to unpack there, and it's not clear how much Beth really knows or guesses about Townes' private life or his intentions at any point in that scene - the focus is on Beth's face when Roger appears too - what does she infer? It's also quite possible to read Roger's speech as a signal to Townes that he's giving him a pass to sleep with Beth - does Townes seem to you like someone who would forget when dinner is? So why does Roger remind him exactly when he will be returning to their room - to avoid interrupting them? Does Beth pick up on this? Is Townes later apology related to it? And why does Roger change into green trunks - a color usually seen on Beth in her moments of sickness or addiction?",

                "comment_text": "Thinking out loud: It strikes me that Beth lives in a world that is very black and white, governed by chess - but she learns that relationships are not black and white. She doesn't have much experience with trustworthy people in her life: abandoned by her parents, and her adoptive father, and let's not forget Cleo. It might be that she only understands relationships as either ***for*** or ***against*** her. But Townes represents a grey area (which is why it is so beautiful that their doomed attraction to each other can resolve in the very last episode as friendship). I think the same applies to Harry and Benny (moving from competitors to love interests to friends) and Jolene (who stole her book - and in the novel approached Beth in the night) who becomes a mentor and friend. Similarly, her relationship with Mr Shaibel is very unusual, meeting as equal minds in spite of their difference in age. Even Alma inhabits a grey space: as adoptive mother she quickly turns into more of a sister figure for Beth and sometimes Beth mothers her instead. To me Townes is the pinnacle of this ambivalence in Beth's relationships and the fact that they end up as friends symbolises the maturity Beth has found so she can function as human being in relationships and not just within the black-and-white constraints of the game that governed her whole mind. This growth curve runs parallel to her growth in chess right from the start when she is orphaned and finally ends up with a sense of belonging. Being able to hold and accept that fluidity in her relationships when they are so much more complicated than the rules on the 64 squares means that Beth ends the series in a place of calm and confidence.",

Green is used to represent Beth's comfort: the green pills that make her feel safe, the green squares that remind her of Mr. Shaibel, the green chair she sits in after Mrs. Wheatley dies, etc. Alternatively, blue is represented to symbolize Beth's discomfort. The blue of the Wheatley's home when she moves in, the blue she wears to the Apple Pi meeting, etc. \n\nHowever, I didn't notice the black and white symbolism in the series! That's a great point that I need to take into consideration, thank you so much for that. \n\nAs for what Townes represents, I'm not sure what you're saying he might represent.

To me it seem as if it's sort of a retelling of the story with new / different aspects\n\nFairly common I'd say.  Bad example perhaps, but I see that in \"superhero\" movies where aspects of a character (say, Batman as vigilante) are explored.\n\nSo comparison to the book may not be relevant other than to point out the director took the main idea and added / changed to make certain points not present in the book nor intended to be.\n\nRegarding your first question - I'm not sure Townes literally represents \"platonic friendship\".  In fact, I'd say that was not the intent at all.  If anything, he represents confusion gay people likely felt in the 60s (and still feel even today).  The platonic aspect is something that spoke to me personally (unimportant, but my first true friend that happened to be female occurred during my first job out of college mid 1970s.  My wife was concerned about that to say the least - but once she met her and we socialized as couples (she was married too) it was no issue.  But the idea of a man/woman being platonic friends even in the 70s was met with suspicion.\n\nSo I'd not go so far as to say Townes represented that.  But I do feel they wanted to make a subtle statement about being gay in the 60s.  It SEEMED like Beth thought Townes was leading her on - and in a sense he actually was.  But as he said, he was confused.  One might imagine he talked in more detail about that to her but we don't see that because the series was about her, not him.\n\nThe \"platonic\" aspect DOES come through loud and clear at the end when all her (male) friends rally around her to help her win.  That's the only aspect I thought was maybe TOO perfect.  But it made the point that she didn't need to feel abandoned; there WERE people who cared.  And that caring was NOT based on her being a woman and them being men.  It was person to person.  Caring and respectful friends.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nAnd you NEED to include the points made by the other poster regarding clothes and color.  I did not catch that at all but it's very insightful.  Roger Ebert once said there are NO coincidences in movies.  EVERY aspect is intentional no matter if it's obvious or not.\n\nThe more obvious one I saw was her dressing in checks.  Remember she said she felt safe in the world of the chessboard - the 64 squares.  The chessboard was her world and she dressed like it.\n\nUntil she won with the help of people who cared deeply for her.  She walked through the park dressed like the white queen.  Now - the world was her chessboard.\n\nVery corny to say it out loud, but that's the point.  The series have those things without hitting us over the head.\n\n\\----------------\n\nLike what happened when she felt drawn to Shiable's \"office\" and saw the clippings.  She said she'd never go back in but I guess felt compelled.  It hit her that someone DID care and she cried to Jolene.  But a corny director would have dialog like \"Oh Jolene - what have I become??\" and then the theme from Rocky would play indicating her turnaround.\n\n\\-------------\n\nSpeaking of which, I think the Jolene character is played very different than the book.  And I think perhaps STILL underplayed in the series.  She is the one who set the turnaround all in motion.  Again, it's subtle but remember this is the south in the 60s.  Whites / blacks weren't generally true friends.  I actually wondered about them playing racquetball.  I'm sure some people would have looked at them together and thought \"WTF?\"\n\nIn the movie Brian's Song (true story) set in the mid/late 60s, black and white  football players being friends (and roommates on the road) was unusual and even unheard of in some sense.\n\nSo the idea that Beth DID have people who cared AND they came from EVERYWHERE, not the \"normal\" places, was powerful.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nSorry for the length - but one more.  The girl who was inspired by Beth to get a medical degree.  VERY significant.  Again, it's the 60s.  Women were said to go to college to meet a successful guy.  To get their \"MRS\" degree,  Women generally were teachers, nurses.  not DOCTORS!!  I told my (adult) son that was VERY powerful.  It went over his head - he thought \"so what\".  The time period of this is a social commentary of its own.\n\n\\-----------\n\nWhew.  that was a real mind dump.  Did I mention I LOVED Queen's Gambit?",

He looks like the 1950s rather than the 1960s. You could take this a step further and consider whether his sexual unavailability marks him out as s Father figure.\n\nGoing with my reading of the hotel scene - that Roger is offering Townes permission to sleep with Beth, and the implication that either Townes is bisexual or that Roger has encouraged him to be more adventurous, but Townes rejects the opportunity - he is strictly monogamous. Maybe that's why Roger is in green trunks - he represents the wrong turn, that sickly green being the color of danger for Beth. Townes is also not a gambler, even when Roger is at the Baccarat table. Townes is safe.\n\nAnd that's why Townes reappears when he does, and not before. Beth couldn't achieve stability with Alma, Benny or Harry. She's reached a point in her career where stability is achievable, and while that's not going to be in a relationship with Townes, his return foreshadows her transcendence of her troubles.",

Because its a bit hard to get into her head like in the book.\n\nAlso he knows her hotel room cause he already met her at the match, so Beth must have invited him in to stay for the night",

                "comment_text": "I can tell how much you love this show and it resonates with me so much as well. It's a very interesting perspective to consider that the show attempted to tackle different themes from the book. I want to also make it as clear as possible that I loved the show so much that I bought and read the book (something that I've never done for any other show) and I criticize it out of a place of kindness in what it could've been. \n\nSince you haven't read the book, I want to say that Beth overcomes her addiction through her self-control and by reaching out for help, unlike what happened in the show. Unlike the show, Beth goes out of her way to search for Jolene and asks her for help and advice. That's one of the most often complaints that I've heard about the show: that \"the drugs won\" and in a way they did because the show does not put the focus on her overcoming her addiction and instead on her relationships to others. Another criticism I hear (and share) is that the Beth in the book seeks out help while the Beth in the show is offered help. \n\n\\-----\n\nAs for the Townes section, that's a great perspective I hadn't thought of. Originally I was under the impression that Townes was put in for representation - and while I'm sure that was part of the reason - I now understand the greater role he played.\n\n\\-----\n\nAs for the color symbolism, that might be my favorite aspect of both works. I've already included the color symbolism of green and blue in the book but I hadn't considered the symbolism of black and white in regard to chess. I think there are a few spots that the show missed such as Beth buying a green-squared chessboard (just like Mr. Shaibel's) when she moves in with Mrs. Wheatley but I will have to go back and compare both of them with regard to the symbolism of black and white color usage.\n\n\\-----\n\nJolene. You are more right than you know when you say Jolene played a different role in the book. The only differences I found between the show and book regarding Jolene are two examples:   \n1) When Beth arrives at the orphanage, Jolene r\\*pes her and   \n2) Beth reaches out to Jolene for help instead of Jolene showing up on her doorstep\n\nI think the 1st example is completely unnecessary in the book because it has no effect on Beth, the plot, or any other part of the book. I don't understand why it was in the book so I don't consider it a relevant scene or even a necessary one since it has no impact on the story.\n\n\\-----\n\nPlease don't apologize for the long post! I love these kinds of in depth conversations and detailed examples! :) \n\nIn fact, my paper is nearing 20 pages and will easily go over 30 as of now. So I'm definitely no stranger when it comes to a detailed breakdown. \n\nTo clarify then, do you mean that the Netflix adaptation decided to tackle the theme of defying gender roles or expectations more than the addiction that Beth struggles with? \n\nIf yes, do you think Townes was part of the new theme?\n\nIf no, can you edit my clarification to your description?\n\n\\-----\n\nI loved The Queen's Gambit too! <3 (if I didn't make it clear enough yet :) )",

(Besides the wearing checks and then the \"white queen\" symbolism.\n\nBeth was tough to like even though we saw what she was going through.  I mean - KNOWING your mother WANTED her to die along with her?\n\nSo she built a wall around her (BTW, I absolutely was hearing Pink Floyd's \"another brick in the wall\" after a while.  Hey, I'm a \"boomer\".  Dad and grandpa.Don't hold it against me!\n\nBut when it was revealed she didn't pay back Schaible I thought - enough is enough.  My younger son (an avid chess player in HS, now in his 30s and a dad himself) was done watching the series and we had been texting a LOT about it. NO spoilers though.\n\nAt that point I turned off the TV and said to him - that's it.  I can't watch anymore.  I'm disgusted.\n\nHe said - \"dad, hang in there.  You are SUPPOSED to be disgusted.  That's what makes what happens next work so perfectly.\n\nHe of course was right.  Without that realization in the church service, Beth would not have felt drawn to going back in despite saying she never would.  And then all that followed from that.\n\nI get the impression the book didn't do it that way.  I almost feel the show was a VERY different story.\n\nOne more quick one - more to come later.  I understand your point that book showed Beth helping herself.\n\nI might say though that is a VERY different message than the movie has.  Both are powerful, both are thought provoking.  But the idea of a person understandably building a wall around themselves - and having people to care enough to help her despite that - resonated with me more.\n\nAre you familiar with mbti?  Beth is characterized as an INTJ.  I am an INTP.  Both types very much \"loners\" on the surface.\n\nBut the main difference between the two is INTJs tend to be focused and driven to succeed at what they are focused on.  INTP tend to bounce from one interest to another - knowing enough to convince themselves they COUDL master it but move on to something else.\n\nYet both types have a tendency to think \"I don't' need anyone else\".\n\n(I may have just added another 5-10 pages to your paper!)\n\nYou see, it touches me when I realize people that understand me care about me even though it can seem as if I don't' care about them.  I don't' mean family.  Of course we care.  I mean a couple of close friends.\n\nEDIT - sorry I don't' have time for the post above; hopefully tomorrow.  Don't worry - I do enjoy sharing thoughts / opinions with you.  And anyone reading - feel free to chime in!!",

There must be other examples of that .  \n\nTrivial but I DO know that happens a lot with super-heroes.  Retelling of the origin story of Superman or Batman.  Key figures playing expanded or very different roles Etc.\n\nI think that's evident in what you've been saying - and speaking ONLY for myself, I like the series version better.  The theme there is \"we DO need other people no matter how accomplished we are.  ESPECIALLY when life has created a very understandable need for us to build a wall around us to protect us",

Nothing I could say could change that, if you\u2019re viewing experience wasn\u2019t good. \n\nWhat I love about the series is these characters that I have formed a bond with. It intrigues me to see Beth going through her highs and lows, losing her ambition and getting it back, discovering sexuality, trying to overcome her affinity for drugs and most importantly maturing. Combined with the great set pieces, costumes, camera work and soundtrack, the world of Queens Gambit is able to make me feel at home. It is a masterpiece from this perspective.",

This allowed threads to be seen without being touched years after they were posted to give people an idea of how discussions and engagements were treated at the time, or before certain information was made available. While I wholeheartedly disagree with that being suddenly switched on by default site-wide, this is a sub that can definitely benefit from it. A few points:\n\nOur episode discussion guides are now reopened and restickied. People can continue to comment and reply in each thread, both new viewers and old. A while back, I was planning on organizing a rewatch, but shortly after my life became a bit more hectic, so I apologize for that falling through. I'd still like to do it, maybe sometime soon especially since the show will become 1 year old this Saturday (wow!).\n\nOld threads on obscure topics can continue. If someone really wanted to talk about a specific outfit Beth wore, or something that happened in a specific scene, you can still reply to people and discuss in old threads without making a new thread that may not get much attention and discussion. \n\nLastly, this will make it basically impossible to keep an eye on every thread. No mod team, no matter how big, can keep an eye on every single post and thread in their entire sub. We will be heavily relying on you to use the report button, especially on these old threads. I can't see this being a big problem here, this is a pretty chill sub but just wanted to make you aware, in the future you may see a nasty comment made 4 months ago that no one ever read because it's on a 1 year old post. It's up to you to inform us of these. \n\nAnd that's about it, pretty straight forward. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!\n\nJabrono",

                "comment_text": "That's... *one* perspective to take...\n\nHere's another. The queens gambit is about control and trust. Beths biological mother did not trust the biological father to be fit to help her raise her child. So she took control and Beth away from him. And when she couldn't handle it anymore (due to psychological reasons) she decided to end her life as a last show of control. (In the book Beth isn't with her).\n\nThe orphanage takes complete control over Beth. Body and mind. They controled how she looks, what she wears, what she can and cannot do. They controled her mind with drugs. Mr. Shaible controled her at first. Dismissing her. Then always plaing white (first). He didn't trust her to be a worthy oponent. But through time, she earned his trust. Until the orphanage took control over her and forbade it. \n\nWhen Beth was adopted, her new parents didn't trust her. Beth had to fight for every bit of control over her own life. What little she could use her money on. Stealing the rest. She mistrusted everyone. And with good reasons. Then on the toilet at the tournament, she had no choice but to trust the other girl. Because she couldn't contol what was happening to her body. \n\nThe now somewhat famous quote about the 64 squares that she can control. Reflecting how she still doesn't really trust anything outside of it. \n\nHer relation with Alma was built on trust. Slowly. To the point where Beth trusted her enough to tell her she spends the night with others and Alma trusting her not to do something stupid.  Giving *her child* more and more control as it grows up. They both took control over their time together, even lying to the school. Alma finally trusting Beth enough to ask her for a share of the money knowing she wouldn't outright laugh in her face. Beth feeling her trust betrayed when Alma spent way too much time with that mexican, who in turn betrayed Almas trust, just like her husband did. Beth trying to retain control over her emotions when Alma dies. \n\nBeth then trying to control her life. Even trying to somewhat control her relation to Beltik and Watts, learning she can't. She tries to trust them, but never really. She can't control others. She can't control what they think of her. She can only control herself. So when she wears fancy clothes, she doesn't do it to impress others, she does it, because she can. \n\nBut the drugs and alcohol still control her. She trusts Jolene enough to let her help her. Regaining control over her addiction to some extend. \n\nBorgov controls her. Wipes the floor with her twice. Controls her thoughts. She fought alone and lost and lost again. In russia, she was controled by that agent, most likely her every step was monitored by the KGB. Only when she gave up control and trusted her friends she was ready to fight back. And then, ultimately, she had to learn to trust *herself*, not the drugs, that she can win and she did. Finally able to let go of that need for control. Just playing the game and trusting the one on the other side to just want to play the game, too. \n\nNo politics, no agenda, just two people playing a game. \n\nNow... to be honest, I just pulled most of that out of a certain body part of mine... but it fits, doesn't it? Maybe it even fits more than some thin interpretation Tevis wrote it to either appraise or deconstruct the american dream. \n\nYes, the rags to ritches, underdog to victory story is pretty american, but what I loved about the story is how *little* a role politics playes. It wasn't america versus russia. It was Beth versus Borgov, which just happens to be a russian, because, well... chess. Beth is so ultimately not a typical american hero. And every time someone tries to force that lable on her (the church ladies, the agent, the press) it's almost played for laughs and she outright refuses. \n\nBeth never cared about ideology. She just wanted to play good, challenging chess.",

Anything and everything published at that time did its darndest to portray the USA as the shining good guys and the USSR as cold hearted monsters. But not in this book. \n\nI can only take it as a very concious decision by Tevis to *not* play into these patriotic stereotypes. He could easily have made the US look better and the USSR worse than he did. But he didn't. Again, anyone even remotely trying to go in that direction is not portrayed in a favourable light in that story. Tevis showed that there are humans on both sides. And especially the top players on both sides are crucially not defined by their country of origin or their political views or values. They just want to play a game and see who is the better player. \n\nIf he foresaw the very recent development of \"self before country\" at *that* time, then wow... he's a prophet. I think a much more likely explanation would be that he was sick of exactly that kind of politisation and tension in the cold war that he deliberatly wrote a story as much devoid of it as possible.",

And,  I believe that Tevis works against that overly simplistic view of the world and against that political agenda, which I really like, btw. I like the truthfulness of his presentation. The game matters most. \n\nBut then, its the individualism that wins and inspires,  which goes back to the American value of \"individualism\".\n\nYou can't forget that the main political conflict between the USSR and the USA at the time was individualism versus collectivism. That was at the heart of the cold war. \n\nHarmon wins over Borgov because she's playing with the creative freedom that only an individual mindset can access. Borgov's chess game - and all the Soviet players - are limited by the Soviet system.  They cannot grow outside that box. Harmon wins because she is not controlled by a collective. \n\nThe USA is far from fantasy, but it is better than the Soviets because of its support of the individual. That's Tevis final statement. The USA did not only work against her genius. The school chess club helped her. She competed, and the chess society recognized and encouraged her to compete more and to succeed.\n\nThe USA is flawed. The Soviet Union's also flawed. The USA is better only in that it supports the individual and his/her pursuit of excellence, a dream, happiness.",

She felt alone and miserable, but now *together* they can work on a strategy. Just like the russians did. And this working together to achieve a common goal was always portrayed as the biggest strength the russians had. \n\nSure, in the end she won going off plan and doing her thing. But that was one thing one time. A blip on the radar, a curiosity. It wasn't even the world championship. The world of chess is still firmly in the grip of the russians and their way of learning, teaching and living it. \n\nAnd it is a very american view to think that you can only achieve excellence and happiness through individualism.",

Fourth time watching the season through all the way and it\u2019s still one of my favorite parts. When she\u2019s walking through the park in Russia with all the older generation playing and they recognize her and they love her and want to play chess together. Feels so wholesome and makes me happy after all the depression and problems in the series.",

It also paralleled Shiobel, when she was little she was determined to win and finally had a purpose.

        "text": "So I\u2019m watching the queens gambit for the first time and really enjoying it. It\u2019s a great show and I love Anya Taylor Joy\u2019s performance. However, I have a little issue after watching episode 3. At about 38:20, she moves her king 2 spaces and then she moves her rook from the right of the king (her right) to the left. I do not think this is allowed for several reasons. 1) Kings are only allowed to move 1 space at a time 2) you are only allowed 1 move per game and 3) pieces can\u2019t move through/over other pieces with the exception of the knight. Now I want to let you guys know that I only know the basics of chess and I don\u2019t play often. Maybe professional chess plays differently but I wouldn\u2019t have thought so. Also, I\u2019m only on episode 4 at the time of writing so maybe this gets explored later? I\u2019m not saying the character meant to cheat, maybe it was a mistake that no one picked up on and Beth lost so her cheating (whether accidental or purposeful) didn\u2019t cause her to win unfairly. I haven\u2019t seen anyone else asking about this and I haven\u2019t spotted any other mistakes like this although admittedly I haven\u2019t been looking very hard. It was just bothering me and I wanted to see if anyone else noticed and/or had an explanation.",

        "text": "Having seen Queen's Gambit an embarrassing five times, and having gone back now to read the book for the first time, I can't help but come to the conclusion that Scott Frank--as well received as he is--somehow remains vastly underappreciated/underrated. What he has done as the initiating vision and overarching director of this series is nothing short of shatteringly spectacular. The series not only stands on its own two feet, shining just as brightly as the source material, but it *exalts* the source material with its own dire excellence. \n\nScott Frank's original writing is a force unto itself. He doesn't NEED to adapt. His prowess as a writer is deeply formidable. Take GODLESS, for exampled. It's a 7-episode series on Netflix; a Western. There are points in the show that are so well written and performed that I had to pause and leave the room to decompress and process before continuing. I was 100 percent certain it was an adaptation, and I went to look up who the original author was... and was dumbfounded to learn that the author's name was Scott Frank. It's truly an extraordinary work of art. The only other show I can think of that even comes close to it in terms of feeling as if you're in the presence of literature is the first season of True Detective.\n\nMy point in all this is to say, the man understands what the heart of literature is, and what the heart of filmmaking is, and the way he weaves them together like two strands of DNA in the adaptation of the Queen's Gambit... it's like experiencing a new form of art to me. I've never had an experience like the one I had watching the Queen's Gambit. I've never been so penetrated emotionally and moved so profoundly, not just by the story or the performances, but by the ferocious and unyielding presence of greatness throughout the parameters of the execution; the camera work, the editing, the sound, the score, every last part of the engine was exploding like a well honed race car, but driven with such ultimate care, as if the race car was filled with sleeping infants. So much power commanded with such aching delicacy. What an absolute and overwhelming joy to experience. All I can say is I am now googling \"Scott Frank\" more than any other set of words in my life. Bravo! I can't wait to see what comes next.",

I think it's a grievous oversight, but that's just my opinion, as I was very moved by their respective performances. I thought Bill Camp gave a performance for the ages as Mr. Shaibel.\n2. I feel strongly that Anya's performance was not only the best in her category, but one of the finest performances I've seen in recent years, regardless of category, so I'm really hoping she wins this, as I think it's well deserved.\n3. If Thomas Brodie-Sangster had been snubbed I don't think I'd even be able to type right now. Really hoping he wins this. What a performance.\n4. The cinematography and editing were both so excellent that at points I wept just because of the beauty and the accomplishment. Truly superb. These are no-brainer wins imo.\n5. I felt the same way about the sound mixing and the score. There was some really gorgeous and subtle stuff going on; some of it was an actual display of genius imo.\n6. This is the first time in my life I've ever felt genuine giddy excitement for the Emmys; that's how much I loved The Queen's Gambit. :)\n7. Scott Frank is someone I can't stop googling now. His vision and leadership were just remarkable, given the overarching execution of the show. Looking forward to what he does next, and to going back and rediscovering some older work.",

Jeff Daniels won an Emmy for his turn as one of the best baddies of all time. It's dark! Also, it's not an adaptation; Scott Frank wrote it all by himself. And it murders.",

        "text": "The Queens Gambit is an extraordinary work of fiction; it's so nuanced and realistic that many throughout the years have erroneously assumed that Beth Harmon was based on a real person. Further, people aren't aware that Walter Tevis has authored several other high profile works which have been successfully adapted. \n\nHere is his list of books and the adaptations, in order of publication:\n\n1. **The Hustler** (made into a film staring Paul Newman, which was nominated for nine Oscars, winning two of them). \n2. **The Man Who Fell to Earth** (made into a film starring David Bowie. It didn't win any awards but amassed a dedicated cult following and remains revered by fans of both sci fi and David Bowie). An amazing sci fi novel, described by crime author James Sallis thusly:  \"*The Man Who Fell to Earth* is among the finest science fiction novels. Just beneath the surface it might be read as a parable of the Fifties and of the Cold War. Beneath that as an evocation of existential loneliness, a Christian fable, a parable of the artist. Above all, perhaps, as the wisest, truest representation of alcoholism ever written.\"\n3. **Mockingbird** (yet to be adapted). A gorgeous sci fi novel about an android who has been alive for centuries and longs to experience death. \n4. **The Steps of the Sun** (yet to be adapted). Another sci fi novel. This one was largely rejected by Americans for positing that China would become the world's leading superpower (cough, cough).\n5. **The Queens Gambit** (Tevis has cited this to be his favorite, and claims that he wrote it as an \"ode to brainy women\").\n6. **The Color of Money --** the sequel to The Hustler. (The film adaptation starred Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. It was nominated for four Oscars, one of which was for Best Actor, won by Paul Newman). \n\nFrom Tevis's Wiki:\n\n\u2022 Tevis was a frequent smoker, gambler and alcoholic, and his works often included these vices as central themes.\n\n\u2022 His books have been translated into 18 languages.",

With other adaptations of other books, most of the time a \"scene\" in a book is much longer and in much more detail than what ends up in a movie or TV show. \n\nWhich is great (for the book), when it can describe the mood or the motivations of the characters in more depth. But in more than just a few cases authors go on tangets that are not relevant for the main story. They usually have so many ideas an character traits and just so much \"knowledge\" about their world and everyone in it and try to show that to the reader. \n\nTevis on the other hand (and again only from my experience with TQG) seems very focussed. Knows exactly what story beats are needed and cuts out anything that doesn't move the story foreward without being terse. Which is perfect for screenplays. \n\nSo his other books are definitely on my (ever growing) pile of \"to read\", with the intend to compare them to the movies then. Hoping the other two will get adapted, too.",

                "comment_text": "I am blown away by the capacity of Tevis to seamlessly weave multiple vantages, time frames, memories, facets into a single paragraph. On the surface, Beth is simply walking up the street, or laying in bed. But the entire world is coming into the picture, via memories, speculation, imagination, and the actual live world in the present moment. By way of example:\n\nScene: Beth walking home.\n\n>Walking home with the folded magazine tucked securely against her flat belly she thought again about that rook move Morphy hadn\u2019t made. The magazine said Morphy was \u201cperhaps the most brilliant player in the history of the game.\u201d The rook could come to bishop seven, and Black had better not take it with his knight because\u2026 She stopped, halfway down the block. A dog was barking somewhere, and across the street from her on a well-mowed lawn two small boys were loudly playing tag. After the second pawn moved to king knight five, then the remaining rook could slide over, and if the black player took the pawn, the bishop could uncover, and if he didn\u2019t\u2026 She closed her eyes. If he didn\u2019t capture it, Morphy could force a mate in two, starting with the bishop sacrificing itself with a check. If he did take it, the white pawn moved again, and then the bishop went the other way and there was nothing Black could do. There it was. One of the little boys across the street began crying. There was nothing Black could do. The game would be over in twenty-nine moves at least. The way it was in the book, it had taken Paul Morphy thirty-six moves to win. He hadn\u2019t seen the move with the rook. But she had. Overhead the sun shone in a blank blue sky. The dog continued barking. The child wailed. Beth walked slowly home and replayed the game. Her mind was as lucid as a perfect, stunning diamond.\n\nScene: Beth laying in bed\n\n>Sometimes chess would keep her awake at night for hours. It was like Methuen, except that she was more relaxed and not afraid of sleeplessness. She would lie on her mattress on the living-room floor after midnight with New York street noises coming in through the open bay window and study positions in her mind. They were as clear as they had ever been. She did not take tranquilizers, and that helped the clarity. It was not whole games now but particular situations\u2014positions called \u201ctheoretically important\u201d and \u201cwarranting close study.\u201d She lay there hearing the shouts of drunks in the street outside and mastered the intricacies of chess positions that were classic in their difficulty. Once during a lovers\u2019 quarrel where the woman kept shouting, \u201cI\u2019m at my fucking wit\u2019s end. At my wit\u2019s fucking end!\u201d and the man kept saying, \u201cLike your fucking sister,\u201d Beth lay on her cot and came to see a way of queening a pawn that she had never seen before. It was beautiful. It would work. She could use it. \u201cUp your ass,\u201d the woman shouted, and Beth lay back exulting and then fell pleasantly asleep.\n\nThe writing seems simple and straight forward, just \"tell what's happening\", but it's deceptively multifaceted and layered.",

By following her discovery with \"Overhead the sun shone...\", it gives us a hint that this is a moment of jubilation, but then it's taken away by the word \"blank\". The book is filled with these touches. It's really quite lovely and impressive.",

I wasnt able to read Game of Thrones after watching the show, as it was really similar and i lost motivation in reading quickly. But i liked the Queens Gambit a lot and am interested in thr book. For instance i really enjoyed Haunting of Hillhouse even after watching the show, as it has a completely different story. Does anyone know how Queens Gambit is in that regard?",

                "comment_text": "Here are some contrasts: \n\nTonally and at points scenically the book is darker. Beth is less warm and more realistic. Her alcoholism comes across as far more brutal and self-destructive. Jolene attempts to force herself sexually on Beth while in the orphanage, and Tevis doesn't pull back on the description of this event. When Beth fights her way out of it Jolene proceeds to be very insulting toward Beth in latter days. However, their friendship survives this, and it's Beth that seeks out Jolene as an adult in the book, not the other way around; we also get into Beth's head and learn that she really loves Jolene, perhaps more than anyone else in her life. So, yes, there are pockets that are lighter in the book, and you come away from reading it with a generally positive mood, but the overarching literate tapestry is definitively more dark. \n\nI think the most important difference is the prose of the author (Walter Tevis), which appears simple on the surface, but is deceptively multifaceted and layered, and it's not something that is adaptable into a film; it's pure literature. Tevis seamlessly weaves multiple vantages, time frames, memories, facets into a single paragraph, via memories, articles, speculation, imagination, all while maintaining the present reality, which in his hands is almost like a character unto itself. By way of example: \n\n>Walking home with the folded magazine tucked securely against her flat belly she thought again about that rook move Morphy hadn\u2019t made. The magazine said Morphy was \u201cperhaps the most brilliant player in the history of the game.\u201d The rook could come to bishop seven, and Black had better not take it with his knight because\u2026 She stopped, halfway down the block. A dog was barking somewhere, and across the street from her on a well-mowed lawn two small boys were loudly playing tag. After the second pawn moved to king knight five, then the remaining rook could slide over, and if the black player took the pawn, the bishop could uncover, and if he didn\u2019t\u2026 She closed her eyes. If he didn\u2019t capture it, Morphy could force a mate in two, starting with the bishop sacrificing itself with a check. If he did take it, the white pawn moved again, and then the bishop went the other way and there was nothing Black could do. There it was. One of the little boys across the street began crying. There was nothing Black could do. The game would be over in twenty-nine moves at least. The way it was in the book, it had taken Paul Morphy thirty-six moves to win. He hadn\u2019t seen the move with the rook. But she had. Overhead the sun shone in a blank blue sky. The dog continued barking. The child wailed. Beth walked slowly home and replayed the game. Her mind was as lucid as a perfect, stunning diamond.\n\nThe scene is simply: Beth walks home. But through an article in the magazine she is carrying (not reading, but already having skimmed) we delve into the distant past of the days of Morphy. Then we are brought into Beth's head as she realizes a mistake that Morphy made in the game. Around her children are playing their own game, and eventually one of them starts crying, so the world is changing and evolving around her as she walks. Upon her realization that Morphy not only made a mistake, but that she's very likely superior to him, we learn that the \"Sun is shining overhead\"; however, before we can claim this as a sign that Beth's mood is jubilant and not merely calculating, we are told that the sky is \"blank\" (not clear), rendering the sunny day as no more or less relevant than the barking dog. \n\nIt's brilliant and layered writing that masquerades as simple and straight-forward. You'll see instances of it as many times as you'll turn the pages of the book; he made it all look so easy. And it makes it all very much worth reading. \n\nThere are also some fairly major characterization differences, such as Benny is nothing like a pirate (though the pirate character that the Netflix Benny was partially culled from is in the novel, known only as \"chess bum\"; he shows up for a paragraph early on and we never hear from him again, or learn his name). Someone commented here that Cleo is not in the book, however she is, albeit only during the scene in Benny's apartment (not in France), and her name is \"Jenny\".  The twins, however, are altogether absent, and you'll discover that the majority of their dialog was taken directly from the book's narrative. In fact, any scene in the series where there is exposition (such as that of Beth narrating her loss to Benny for the benefit of her mother (which I thought was the only real mistake in the series; it would have been more powerful to experience the actors carrying the gravity of the moment with their facial expressions and body language, free from exposition) is generally taken straight from the novel's narrator. \n\nTLDR: if, after watching the show, you were left with a void in your soul because you wanted more, the novel is a GREAT way to fill that void. You will get lost in it; it's truly excellent and I highly recommend it.",

                "comment_text": "Okay, so two things, one kind of bad news and one potentially good news:\n\n1. There is no way by asking people in this subreddit that you will get enough responses or any responses to be able to analyze the data in roughly one week.\n2. What you can do, however, is search this subreddit for posts and comments about specific scenes. I am sure you can dig up a decent amount of content on people's takes on the first episode ending with the giant bottle of pills, but maybe not so much the others. If you have already written in length about the others, I still suggest you ditch them. Ultimately, focusing on scenes where many more people have left their thoughts will give you more data and will make writing about the new scenes much easier anyway. I recommend looking into some of the following scenes:\n\n* When Cleo comes to Paris and ends up getting Beth completely hammered the night before her match against Borgov. TONS of posts about this.\n* When Townes invites Beth into his hotel room to take photos of her for the newspaper, and things get a bit sexually/romantically tense, and then the man who is clearly Townes' lover briefly enters and then leaves the scene. Lots and lots of posts about this.\n* Beth's total breakdown/bender where she ends up passed out on the floor after her whole drunk-dancing to \"Venus\" scene. People have discussed the portrayal of her addiction, etc. a lot with regard to this scene.\n* All of Beth's American chess \"friends\" and supporters on the phone with her during the adjournment with Borgov in Russia. Lots of posts on here about it.\n* When Beth goes to Mr. Shaibel's funeral and then returns to the orphanage, goes into his office, sees how he kept the photo of them and kept up with her chess career through the newspapers, and then cries in Jolene's car. Definitely a popular post here.\n* The Beth & Benny sex scene. People have posted about this A LOT.\n* Beth distracting the young Russian player by making a move and then suggestively dancing away - people have a lot of different opinions on this and it's been asked a lot before.\n\nIf you just need four scenes, go through the subreddit (search within the sub) and see which ones have the most posts/comments. Then, collect all of the comments by hand (just copy them and paste them into a word document), separating each scene you're focusing on into a different document so you can more easily analyze people's responses separately. Seriously, collect all the comments that are relevant. Then, once you have fully exhausted your search of the subreddit, go to your documents and weed out any comments that do not at all touch on a visual aspect of the scene - but do not delete comments that allude to it but are not explicit. Many things about the visual aspects may be implicit - honestly, that depends on the scenes you choose as well.\n\nOnce you have \"cleaned\" your data, go through each document separately, one at a time, and \"code\" posts/comments for different broad themes you may have in mind already, using the \"insert comment\" function on Word. Then, when you want to quickly identify how many times a certain theme exists in the data, just search your \"theme\" comment, selecting \"search comments only\" (in the side bar), and it will give you an exact count, and will also allow you to quickly find commentary you'd like to include as data to represent a specific theme. Do this for each scene you choose.\n\nI know it's just an undergrad thesis and it would be nice to just, say, collect the first ten comments on each scene that alludes to the visual aspects of the scene, and not go through everything, but then you can't defend your data against serious bias because perhaps more recent or top comments may, for some reason (think unspecified variable you can't control for, and you really don't want to deal with that if you're a statistician) systematically vary from the general average. Of course, there will always be some bias in research, since you may miss a comment, etc., but do be thorough.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work, but I have done content analysis research very successfully like this for a while now (think papers published in respected academic journals), and once you get rolling, especially once you've gathered your data in a document, you really do just get sort of sucked into it and it goes quickly. Plus, I am sure you can keep your main themes of interest quite simple and broad - no need to do focused or structured coding for an undergrad thesis that also is very very very close to being due. Also, this subreddit is active, but not NEARLY as active as a lot of other subs, plus it's a relatively new subreddit, so it's unlikely you will be completely inundated with relevant commentary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really, really urge you to take my advice. If you do it right, your thesis will be great. But please do not put any more effort into asking people their reactions to the visual aspects of very specific scenes, because if you do, you will not finish your thesis. I know that sounds harsh, but that is what I would tell any student I mentor who came to me in this situation.\n\nedit: typo",

                "comment_text": "Well, I'll try to give a few ideas, hope it helps.\n\nFirst off, idk how familiar you are with questionnaires, but according to my experience (I have a BA degree, studying at an MA level, and I've completed tons of questionnaires for others too), you should start with a page about data: this can contain gender, age, level of studies so far, etc. so that you can analyse data paired with different target groups. As another comment suggested, you might wanna decide on a target group too, but I'm not sure if you have enough time for that. Important question here - at least I think so: \"have you seen Queen's Gambit before?\". If you have a facebook profile or anything else on social media, I suggest you share the questionnaire there, because here on this subreddit you're obviously gonna get results from those who have seen the series. Well, except if your target group is this audience, then it's fine. But I think if you want genuine, non-biased experiences from the participants (e.g. them knowing the ending, the background of certain characters, etc. might help but might also hinder your research), then you're better off sharing it with people who don't know the series. Using both audiences might lead you to best results imo, because then you can see both sides, if you have enough answers.\n\nAs for questions, you can decide on what to look at. Maybe don't be afraid of them being too straightforward; I used analyses of literary excerpts in my thesis that I thought were fairly obvious, but many people had different opinions than me, they had another POV. Anyway, yes, you can give questions of whether they agree to certain things. That's easiest. If they have to give lengthy answers, they'll get bored or tired of it. I'd definitely use questions with something like:\n\n* 1-5\n* definitely disagree, mostly disagree, slightly disagree, neutral / don't know, slightly agree, mostly agree, definitely agree\n* or if you wanna omit neutral answers, give like, 1-4\n\nThese can be, e.g.:\n\n* Does this scene induce fear in you?\n* Does this scene induce excitement in you?\n* Does this scene make you feel stressed? --> and here, you can ask them to describe in a few words both on an emotional and physical level, what they feel. E.g. increased heart rate, feeling the need to cry - for physical. For emotional - embarrassment, pity, discomfort, etc. You could also list these feelings and ask them to tick the boxes for what they feel or give a yes/no answer for them.\n\nBut you can also ask them to describe in 1-2 sentences e.g. how they felt about a certain character who was meant to provoke some feeling in the audience in your opinion. Whether watching the chess game is intense for them or boring. Connected to that, you can ask them to describe their level of knowledge in chess, because this can also affect the quality of their experience. You can ask them how they feel about Beth's mother also, whether they think she seemed in need of help, or whether she was irresponsible. Whether they blame her or feel for her.\n\nThat's all I could think of rn. I'm no expert, it's just how I'd do it. Hope it helps!\n\nEDIT: You might wanna choose just two scenes maybe. I was too ambitious with my thesis as well, and I ended up with less answers than I could have. So if it's not extremely necessary, I'd just choose the most important scenes. But you might need them, it depends on your research, so you should decide.",

Brainstorm them, and then pick the one that interests you most.\n\nSecond, what do you want to say about this theme in relation to the novel? This is your position, and a concise one sentence statement of this will be your thesis.\n\nThree, what\u2019s your argument that establishes this thesis? This will take exegetical work. What in the show will help defend the premises of your argument, and build up to defending your position?\n\nFour, what\u2019s a way that someone can object to you? How might someone with a different view or interpretation push back?\n\nFive, what\u2019s your response to your objector? What makes your argument better than theirs?\n\nHere\u2019s an example but using a different story, say The Sun Also Rises. Maybe I want to explore the theme of masculinity in the novel: I\u2019ll argue that Hemingway portrays the lost generation as having abandoned traditional conceptions of manhood. I\u2019ll argue for this by pointing out how Jake\u2019s impotence \u2014 which is straightforwardly related to masculinity \u2014 makes him unviable as a partner to the women he loves, Lady Brett Ashley. Maybe I can interpret Jake\u2019s impotence as a loss of his traditional masculinity. I might also point out how Brett, a woman, seems to dominate all the men in her life. This definitely is some subversion of traditional masculinity. Then there\u2019s also something to be said of how Romero is the one who seduces Brett, very similarly to how he dominates the bulls he fights. How Hemingway seems to glorify this traditionally very manly activity, and how he depicts the bullfighter being successful in amorous affairs that Jake isn\u2019t, might suggest something about masculinity also. \n\nObviously this example is vague \u2014 the thesis should be more specific, and the arguments should be crisper, and I didn\u2019t consider an objection / reply. But this should help you get started!",

She assumed (if she gave it any thought at all) that his interest in her had ended with his $5 affirmation which had made it possible for her to enter her first chess tournament. It was their last direct communication.\n\nBut suddenly, glancing toward the back of his work area she sees something that looks familiar. On closer examination she finds that Mr. Shaibel had collected and preserved in this dreary basement that was now the cache of his life,  every piece of media ever published about her during her chess career. Tournament wins and losses, images, background stories, even the letter she had sent him requesting the $5 loan and the photo Mr. Ganz had taken of them when she was 9 years old. The only photo ever taken of them together. In this collection she recognizes his enduring  love and admiration\u2026 for her.\n\nAnd then suddenly it hits her. In her life people had always left her. Some by choice, some in death, but just as Alice, her mother, had once warned  \u201cone day you will be alone.\u201d  That fear of ending up alone was the basis of the constant anger in her that Shaibel had seen at once and warned her about.  But here in Shaibel\u2019s collection she discovers, she never really was alone. Shaibel had never left her. She had left him. And that sudden realization brought her to tears and finally dissolved the anger that had been her life-long companion. His final gift to her.  (It turns out Jolene had followed her too, but not with this detail.)

Her walk and body language grew more confident as she became more successful and reverted to the little girl poses whenever she was unsure or challenged. I don't know if that was the director's idea but it felt more like something she put personally into the role. I'm also impressed with how much she can convey without even speaking. She has the same ability that Scarlet Johansson does to shift her facial expressions really subtly to convey what the character is thinking or feeling. I wasn't super impressed with her in some of her earlier films (except for The Witch) but after watching QG I said to my wife \"if she doesn't win a bunch of awards for this I'll be really surprised\".",

It was just a magical production where so many things came together just right. Very difficult to reproduce.

        "text": "In The Queen's Gambit featurette, the very first person in the video said it's not about chess but about, in his words, 'the cost of genius.' I understand when people say there can be natural downsides to talent; being preoccupied and obsessed with something, not fitting in, and more. What I dislike is how The Queen's Gambit, like so much entertainment before it, presents genius as something you have to pay for(usually at the cost of your mental health and stability). I was momentarily happy that The Queen's Gambit doesn't seem to have given Beth a mental disorder(to my knowledge) other than substance abuse disorder, which I think rooted more in an unhealthy coping mechanism from a shitty orphanage rather than something in her from the moment she was born or the direct result of her being a genius. This hope is taken away in statements such as the one above, as well as unrefuted sayings like, 'creativity and psychosis often come hand in hand. Or, for that matter, genius and madness.'\n\nI wish The Queen's Gambit didn't fall into the overused and therefore stigmatising trope of implying that incredible talent comes at the cost of your mental well-being, or that you can't be happy and talented, and I wish it could have remained as a unique approach to mental instability in gifted individuals; that anyone can have mental illness, and anyone can also not have mental illness. People with mental illness can lead happy lives, people without them can be miserable, and you don't have to be mentally unstable to be uniquely gifted in whichever skill you dominate.",

                "comment_text": "I believe I get your point but I don\u2019t think I agree with this. I mean, of course, you are not wrong with your general statement \u2013 people can be excellent at things without mental illness and people who have mental illnesses don\u2019t just happen to be geniuses at the same time. There is no direct causal relation between those two things and I understand your wish for a more diverse portrayal.\n\nBut while there is no causal connection I still feel the trope has developed because there is at least a strong correlation. From my experience the people who have great talent and the discipline to shape their talent into greatness MUST have a strong driving force that keeps them going forward. Greatness comes from exercising and practicing and honing your talent.   \n\n\nAnd those things can and will hurt. Becoming successful is not nearly as hard as staying successful. With a game like chess especially where you have a direct opponent and you have to conquer yourself, your fears, your insecurities. That the state of mind of a gifted individual is something that is being influenced by that pressure seems obvious to me. Sometimes you need to be obsessed with something in order to overcome your obstacles and that DOES come with a price. \n\nGreatness consumes your time, your social life and sometimes even your health. I simply don\u2019t believe anyone can be outstanding without being willing to do push themselves beyond some limits.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAgain, of course Beth could have been amazing without her struggle (and, in fact, she overcomes her greatest rival without the help of drugs). But this is her story, and she IS struggling. You said that you miss the portrayal of people who can be happy while being mentally ill \u2013 I feel like she is about to be very happy. She managed to impress and befriend a group of talented and kind young men who stuck by her side when she needed them the most. Her methods of dealing with people were \u201csocially awkward\u201d at times but they all were drawn to her nonetheless because they saw the real Beth. Someone who does care about people even if she cannot show it in that moment as well as others can.",

                "comment_text": "I see your point. So often, whenever a \"genius\" is portrayed (especially in movies or on TV), they are socially inept or are autsistic or both. And yes, TQG does not fully avoid that trap. But I'm happy that Beth is still shown socializing (well, at least trying to. Not necessarily getting much out of it, at least not at first, but that's simply the case for introverts, which I wouldn't call having a mental disorder). And I didn't get the feeling that she \"suffers\" from her genuis. She suffers from addiction. \n\nNow... a story without some kind of \"struggle\" is usually a boring one. And if the cause of the struggle stems from the same source as the strength, it's such a sweet irony that few storytellers can resist. That's not an excuse but an explanation why we have so many stories where a genuis has mental problems (the mind being the source of both). \n\nCould TQG have handled the subject better? Probably... but in it's defense, it's a story from 1983 so faulting it for the overwhelming amount of geniusses with mental problems that were portrayed in media since then is a bit harsh. Yes, they could have re-written it (which they did, a little.), but you can see how faithful they tried to stay to the book in every aspect, so changing too much would betray that. Yes, they could not have made a TV show of that story altogether. But then we wouldn't have this show that touched so many people so deeply. \n\nAnd I think your criticism simply goes too far. Beth IS both happy and talented. And her incredible talent does NOT *come at the cost* of her mental well being. Her mental well being came from being separated from her father, being raised by her unstable mother that tried to kill her (in the show, not in the book), from being put in an orphanage that drugged her and actively forbade her to use her talents. And from experiencing normalizing alcoholism. \n\nSo while I see your point, this is by far not the worst offender. And while you are of course free to attack anything you want, maybe this should not be near the top of the list.",

I completely get all your points and of course you're correct that you don't have to be mentally unstable to be uniquely gifted.  However, I think it is likely that there is some sort of correlation. That doesn't necessarily mean that being gifted *causes* the problems, so I suppose Mr. Shaibel's musings about what her gift would directly \"cost\" may be incorrect if you think about the phrasing. \n\nBut when you're that good at something that competitive and everyone you're competing against is the best of the best of the best, that *has* to come at a mental cost. Like Beltik said, you have to be really obsessed to win it all. That takes a toll, and some will handle it better than others. Others, like Beth, will feel like tearing their hair right out after a loss. It's just a unique stressor that will affect a population of geniuses much more often than the general population, presumably therefore increasing the risk of unhealthy neuroses. \n\nI've also heard that to be that incredibly gifted at a certain type of cognition or skill is a certain type of neurodivergency. I plan to look into that more later so I don't know how scientifically validated that is, but it does make sense. It's reasonable to think that it's at least probably *correlated* with neurodivergency. And again, that doesn't necessarily directly cause unhappiness, but it adds the particular stressor of being a neurological minority. \n\nThose are all just factors. I think there were many many other clear factors in the show that were part of a complex portrait of Beth's mental health. The sudden, traumatic way that she became an orphan; her caretakers providing her vulnerable, impressionable mind with powerful chemicals to get addicted to at the age of eight; her caretakers punishing her for acting on the substance abuse disorder they gave her by taking away the one thing that she loved; the sudden, traumatic death of the woman who had given her a new home and she had grown to love; and the genetic component from a clearly mentally unstable biological mother are all the other factors that played a hand in her mental instability. Being a chess genius is not the only one. \n\nSorry for writing a fucking novel lmao but I love both this specific topic and this show so I really wanted to give that perspective haha",

I was playing for six hours a day, and when I wasn't playing, I was thinking about it or visualizing moves in my head. It got to a point where I was dreaming about it too, and I couldn't hold a conversation because I would start thinking about chess. I eventually had to completely stop playing chess. I think that's the point Beth got to, but she liked that feeling too much to stop. \n\nI think part of the reason she struggles so much from addiction is because she cannot escape from her own brain unless she is drinking or taking librium. Otherwise, her thoughts just keep racing.",

        "text": "Finally watched this and it was mesmerizing. I felt the plot left a few small dangling loose threads (Chekhov\u2019s guns, really) that I was wondering if anyone else noticed or was fleshed out in the book:\n\n* Borgov handing Beth the King piece as part of his resignation. I felt this was a payoff for the State Department agent (CIA agent I\u2019m guessing?) saying that if there were any \u201cunusual signals\u201d, she should mention them. Handing the King to her appeared to be out of the ordinary and a symbolic gesture way of saying he wanted to defect to America. Either the gesture itself, or perhaps a hidden message placed inside the chess piece is another direction they could have gone with. (Something that Borgov could have had associates of his help to arrange). Since this is Beth\u2019s story, it\u2019s understandable that they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to devote too much time to this, but a one-liner of Beth handing the agent the piece and him saying \u201cthat\u2019s fantastic! It could mean Borgov wants to defect! We\u2019ll get our agencies right on this.\u201d would have been a better payoff than leaving it dangling.\n* The young Russian boy Beth played. I expected her to encounter him again in Russia and I wondered when we\u2019d see her encounter him. Perhaps he\u2019s 16 years old at that point, and he isn\u2019t on the path to becoming a world champion, and his journey has been coming to accept this and he thanks her for bringing him along that path. He still plays chess \u201cfor fun\u201d maybe - it no longer defines his life. Something along those lines. It would have been easy to have a minute or so scene to deliver some sort of payoff on that one given she was in Moscow, and surely this boy would have been in town a part of the tournament or he could have traveled there.\n\nDoes the book pay off on either of these events?",

This isn't a dangling thread or a Chekhov's gun, the thing with the CIA agent just establishes him as a dick and the state of US/USSR relations. Plus, do you seriously want Beth's big victory moment and the great ending to be undercut by a defection message? Nobody cares about Borgov.\n* Everything you say about the young russian boy just sounds like a russian Harry Beltik. I don't think it would've been good or interesting to see that.",

And your reasoning seems off - if the intention was simply to establish the CIA agent as \"a dick\", why would he **specifically** ask about chess related gestures / signals from Borgov? And additionally why would the director zoom in on the piece? TBH, I think this idea was on the director/writers' mind but they decided to trim whatever aftermath scenes or dialog related to this. There's a billion ways the agent could have been \"established\" as a dick, yet this is a very specific reference to unusual gestures during a chess game, and furthermore, the show establishes laying down the king, but never establishes handing a King piece as being a normal gesture. No other character does this.  \nFurthermore, Borgov up to this point doesn't do a single thing to indicate he's a gracious loser who would make this gesture. In fact, he even meets with his colleagues to attempt to thwart Beth's attempts to win. There's **zero** indication he's the kind that would have handed her the piece prior to this as a \"symbolic gracious gesture\" as you put it.  \nI think you dismiss it too easily and unless you have direct evidence from the writer/director, I wouldn't speak so authoritatively.",

But he then got a bit creeped out by the very last scene. \n\nAnyway redditors, what are the latest episodes like in terms of age appropriateness?

But I've heard so many people complaining about the ending like it's tied up with a neat and pretty bow. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with a happy ending. Why not let her be a champion in something and for it to end well instead of it being ambivalent? She earned it, and it was satisfying. I think some of us have come to see ambivalence/cliff hangers as the tell-tale marks of a good show, while a \"happy ending\" seems to be the easy way out, or something. I loved the ending and was grateful the creator chose to end it that way. Thoughts?",

Like \"You could never be a model.\" but then quickly adding \"You're much too smart.\" She enjoys watching Beth play against Benny and the two other guys and win, because she enjoys seeing Benny humiliated.\n\nIn Paris, she wants to meet with Beth to confirm her suspicions and asks very frankly \"did you like fucking Benny\". Beth gives her the weapon right off when she says she has a big match tomorrow and should be well rested for it. So a night of partying will destroy that and Cleo makes sure that happens. And the next day Cleo is there to watch Beth lose against Borgov. Cleo's revenge on them both is complete. After that she's not seen again.\n\nI know Beth didn't steal Benny from Cleo, but I think in Cleo's mind Beth was the key factor that made sure Benny wouldn't get back together with Cleo.",

Script is the best I\u2019ve heard since. Plot and mechanics are also excellent. Peaky Blinders is just as good.\n\nMasters of the Air is a must see especially for aviation and world war enthusiast like me. The technical details, the execution and the drama. Definitely a gem.\n\nPrison Break could be swapped with Peaky Blinders on some days. The only thing that\u2019s keeping it at 4 is its age, hence the video quality and cinematography. It looks really old compare to Peaky B.\n\nBreaking Bad doesn\u2019t need introduction. Could also be my top 2 easily. Just gives me that \u201cold school\u201d vibe especially since the location was set in NM.\n\nHate me for it, but I take into consideration the overall look and feel.

        "text": "SPOILERS AHEAD (DUH!)\n\nI just watched the Queen's Gambit. Can someone please explain to me what I'm supposed to like about this show? How did this show get such praise and approval?\n\n\u00a0\n\nCharacters were poorly developed and faintly motivated. They also kept randomly popping up and reappearing out of nowhere.\n\nThe acting seemed unnatural. Clich\u00e9s on top of clich\u00e9s.\n\nThe chess portion \u2013 OMG\u2026 I'm someone that barely knows how all the pieces move, and I felt the way the game was portrayed was horribly uninspired. It feels like it was written by someone that never played chess, and only knows it as \"a game for smart people\", and \"oh it's so deep and only smart people understand it\". Sure, if they made it actually complex in a way that would be interesting to chess players, they would rule out like 99.9% of their audience reach, but still.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll continue by just rambling on about random bits and pieces:\n\n\u00a0\n\nBeth's character is introduced in the first scene by being wet, and her first words are \"I'm coming\" \u2013 and if that's isn't fitting of the tone of the whole show\u2026 Her character could be summed up with three words: troubled, smart, pretty.\n\nShe\u2019s missing at least 10-15 minutes EVERY DAY (or so it\u2019s portrayed) cleaning the sponges while she plays with the janitor\u2026. and no one bets an eye on it for MONTHS?\n\nBeltik just randomly re-appears out of nowhere \u2013 THREE TIMES! First when he knocks at her door and later moves in, then at the school where he says he\u2019s concerned about her, and then at the end along with Benny helping her win over \"the Russians\".\n\nJolene also shows up OUT OF NOWHERE.\n\nHer adoptive mother: she\u2019s on and off about being supportive with her playing chess, and then disrupting her away from it. Even when she has a financial incentive for her to succeed, she keeps interrupting her. Oh yeah, such a complex and troubled character as well. Yeah right.\n\nThat French model girl!! Omg\u2026.. \"mais oui, bein sur, je suis une modele, je suis Parisienne and je suis bisexuelle, teehee\". Oh, \"Europeans\"\u2026\u2026 She had to be like 7 French movie tropes/clich\u00e9s all in one. Barf.\n\nBorgov is a very stern and serious looking Russian character. Clich\u00e9y clich\u00e9. Are we back in the 80s?\n\nBorgov and his Russian chess pals don\u2019t close the door when they\u2019re discussing strategy because\u2026 PLOT??\n\nRight after \\^this scene the camera circles around the hotel and we can see inside the rooms through the windows \u2013 and the perspective is oh so bad, it is laughable. It looked like something out of a Wes Anderson movie and was so out of style for the rest of the show. Balcony scenes in Mexico City also had some poor CGI/green screen work.\n\nThat one Russian grandmaster chess player (with long hair and a bear) speaks with a\u2026 German accent? o.0\n\nAll the guys she\u2019s beat effortlessly (or with minimal effort) are giving HER advice over the telephone on how to beat a fckin WORLD CHAMPION. She was supposedly levels above their game, and now they\u2019re of help??\n\nTownes is \u201cthe one that got away\u201d and the one that stole her heart because\u2026 what, he looked deep into her eyes while he was photographing her?? WTF. I thought she was gonna say Beltik or Benny when she was asked about that\u2026. left me so confused. That felt so unexplained. But oh, she\u2019s smart and troubled, so she is complex beyond comprehension.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll in all: totally unconvincing, and left me deflated.\n\nI'm trying to see the other perspective. What did you like about the show?",

It\u2019s not going to happen overnight or in a week or a month how it may be years and years and the future but either you\u2019ll find somebody or somebody. Will find you as long as you don\u2019t stop trying. there are some amazing people out there. When you really think about it, people like us have an advantage when it comes to that. all the fake people and bad people aren\u2019t going to even bother so you\u2019ll know immediately but if somebody finally does take the time to get to know you they are guaranteed to be a beautiful person. I\u2019m saying this out of a place of love and not negativity, but it takes a special kind of person to be with somebody like us not because we\u2019re less because they immediately have to look past a few selfish things to really invest enough to develop that kind of connection. Don\u2019t be afraid to wait, and in the meantime, do everything you can to make sure that you are somebody worth loving, and when the two of you finally meet, nobody else will be able to have as strong and meaningful relationship as you do!",

I literally check the Parent's Guide for each show, though sometimes it's not super accurate. \n\nShe enjoys **mystery**, **thrillers**.. big Law & Order fan, Chicago Fire.. whatever. I however don't care for those shows but I do enjoy mystery/**crime** with her.\n\nIf it's complicated like time travel or too many characters she will lose interest and just read while I watch it lol, so it's been tricky coming up with a show every week or so, we usually watch a couple hours on the nights my dad works. it's a good bonding time even when I have to explain the plot and characters every episode. (i do love my mom i promise)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.serializd.com/user/RyanABXY/profile](https://www.serializd.com/user/RyanABXY/profile)\n\nI've seen a lot, my tastes are def different than hers, but in terms of Netflix, here's ones we both enjoyed or least didn't hate:\n\n* Queen's Gambit\n* School Spirits\n* Erased\n* Love on the Spectrum (US+Australia)\n* My Lover My Killer\n* American Nightmare\n* Escaping Twin Flames\n\nI only really got into reviewing everything since November, so there's lots we watched, and plenty we didn't like or fell out of love with. Also, many many movies but we prefer shows so I'm focusing on that\n\nlook at my profile if you're curious if I've watched it. I've seen a lot that she hasn't :)\nEDIT: I'm almost 40 and she's almost 70 if that helps. ",

I was wrong. Fair warning It is about the FLDC cult leader if religion is a touchy subject\n\n++ if you have Hulu / Disney+\n- Wild Crime - docuseries about murders in American national parks. There are a few seasons\n- Only Murders in the Building - dramedy that satires true crime podcasts / series. My parents both love it. There may be sex in a few scenes but super minor part of the show\n\nAlso I saw in your watch list you've watched kdramas - does she like those too or nah?",

Harmon, Borgav, hell the match vs Beltik in Kentucky took place in fucking Latvia in 1955! The final match vs Borgav in \u201cRussia\u201d took place in Switzerland in 1993!\n\nThere were so many \u201cclues\u201d I thought would be later plot points like the KGB watching and \u201ca sign from Borgav\u201d would mean he was going to defect later and the Queen\u2019s Gambit was a metaphor for how she\u2019d help him escape. Or how poisoning one player\u2019s tea meant they would do that to her.\n\nNope.\n\nTotal fiction loosely based on the idea if Bobby Fischer was a girl.\n\nI\u2019m so fucking annoyed.\n",

Suddenly, Claire is transported to 1743 and into a mysterious world where her freedom and life are threatened. To survive, she marries Jamie Fraser, a strapping Scots warrior with a complicated past and a disarming sense of humour. A passionate relationship ensues, and Claire is caught between two vastly different men in two in harmonious lives. `Outlander' is adapted from the best-selling books by Diana Gabaldon.\n\nI highly recommend it!!",

Actually doesn't need to be romance and drama only, am willing to try others!\n\nSome shows I really really enjoyed are: True blood, Wednesday, Witcher S1, game of thrones, money heist, love island, suits (until it got boring), designated survivor, Bridgeton, next in fashion, emily in Paris, mind hunter, the last kingdom, queen's gambit, bodyguard, sex life.\n\nI'm currently watching dynasty and it is a little boring. Dahmer is a bit too dark for my mood. Also on s7 of blacklist and it is kinda slow and repetitive. \n\nPlease help! What else should I watch?",

You sometimes get odd Korean humor that doesn't overstay it's welcome however.\n\nKingdom is a really well done and super entertaining Korean zombie horror in a medieval setting with 2 seasons I believe.\n\nPersonally, Sweet Home (manwha adaption) is like a guilty pleasure to me. You could technically call it the \"low budget Resident Evil\" of Korea... \n\nAnother Korean show, which is very popular at the moment, is called Extraordinary Attorney Woo.\n\nI'd just try any of the Korean shows pretty much. If you like fantasy as much as you say you do, try the Chinese series Handsome Siblings. It has for China typical martial arts. This show became one of my favorites. The Legend of White Snake is similar, but more focused on Romance, but still has great action and drama.",

I say 1 or 3 ought to be what any content creator ought to be targeting if they want to sell to Netflix (since two seems oddly even). And with so many cancelled after 1 or 2, I'd lean heavily toward 1. Just as you say, make a long movie. Maybe the ideal would be a long movie that has a beginning, middle, and definite end... but somehow could be added onto or continued if desired.

I don't mind an episodical show to get cancelled as much as there's still 100% of the picture and not a cliffhanger at the end, ruining any interest in rewatching or it becoming a classic.\nThe only issue are the show producers that desperately want to be the next game of thrones and fear getting cancelled. Ironically if they make it past season 1 they write themselves into a corner. Episodical also allows for a bad episode here and there, as you know next time it's different. This completely removes the issue of the first three episodes not hooking the viewer and getting cancelled.",

Netflix informs the showrunners, \"Okay, we're only investing $45 million for your second season. We expect a minimum of 9 episodes.\"\n\n80% of estimated viewership results in a 20% budget cut and an minimum of eight episodes, etc, and the same formula applies all the way down to 40%.\n\nIf a show gets below 40% of its estimated viewership, then its second season is limited to one feature-length movie. I.e., 30% of estimated viewership allows for a $15 million budget for an 80-minute movie.\n\nIf the \"second season\" gets below 100% of the new, revised viewership estimate, then the show is canceled. Meanwhile, if it gets >133% estimated viewership, then it is renewed for a third season with 4 episodes; >166% results in a third season with 5 episodes; etc.",

You thus have great self-contained story arcs with very little fat to trim and no loose ends. Moreover, unlike US 12+ episode seasons, the UK's focus on fewer episodes means that a single writing team could do the whole show run. That meant you didn't have \"filler episodes\" or \"guest writer\" episodes that could result in a drastic change of tone or inconsistency. (See a couple of Friends episodes to see this in action, there are guest-written episodes that feel like a Benny Hill physical comedy routine instead of wry observational humor.)\n\nThis is also not a new thing, for British TV, either. As long ago as 1979, they made Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a self-contained six-part TV series. They knew they were making something very complex, very gradually-paced, and likely to be ignored by the majority of the viewership for being too difficult and indirect.\n\nThen guess what happened? There was a writer's strike. Suddenly, Tinker Tailor was the only reliable ongoing show for the six weeks of its run. Millions tuned in to this complex, sophisticated spy narrative, and the BBC had an unexpected popular hit - after fully expecting it to appeal only to the \"puzzle solvers\" among the viewership.",

Hopefully it's accessible in Europe too, not just US. It doesn't have to be English speaking.\n\nTV Shows that I've **loved** & watched until the end:\n\n* Fargo !!! (and the Movie)\n* The Serpent !\n* Godless !\n* Sinner\n* Vikings (especially the first seasons!)\n* True Detective!\n* Oz\n* Money Heist (especially the first seasons!)\n* Unbelievable\n* Dexter\n* The Wire\n* Queen's Gambit\n* Dr. House\n* Battlestar Galactica '04\n* Dracula '20 (better than it seems)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMovies that I've **loved**\n\n* **No Country for Old Men**, True Grit, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (big fan of the Coen Bros style)\n* The Usual Suspects, **The Game '97**, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Red Dragon, Grand Hotel Budapest (like Wes Anderson's work), Fracture, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (seen almost all Guy Ritchie made)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm still watching, like them so far, will reach a conclusion once they are done\n\n* The Witcher (maybe just because I enjoyed the game)\n* Sopranos\n* Deadwood\n* Boardwalk Empire\n* Mindhunter\n* Raised by the Wolves\n* Lost (way overdue)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I think is meh or tried and it didn't stick with me (it's just my opinion, sorry)\n\n* The OA (once the story got going it wasn't as convincing to me)\n* Breaking Bad (interesting at first but lost interest as it went on)\n* Squid Game (I know, unpopular opinion, sorry, it was just OK to me)\n* Ozark, Narcos, Lucifer, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot (Love Remi, but this show was meh for me), The Leftovers (this setting just felt silly) + other popcorn or brain dead stuff in general",

        "id": "ovzxdl",
        "text": "Hi,\n\nI noticed some really bad color banding in an episode of queens gambit and in breaking bad the other day. \n\nLooks something like this: [Issue Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540641109802483724/871490587784802304/image0.jpg) (Queens Gambit s01e06 28:11)\n\nIt seems to affect Nvidia GPU's on Windows (I have a 3080). \n\nThe only way I could fix it was to go into the Nvidia Control Panel -> Adjust Video Image Settings -> Noise Reduction -> Use Nvidia Settings (1%). Originally, I thought that Nvidia was doing some debanding that solved the issue, but I think it's a bug since afterwards you can set it back to the original setting and the issue will stay fixed. However the issue comes back after reboots, so I just have left it on 1% for now. \n\nAfter this, it is fixed ->  [Fixed Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540641109802483724/871490906677731328/image0.jpg) It still looks a bit banded in the image, but I think that's just the camera, looked great in person.\n\nI'm curious if this is an issue for everyone, and if so if I should be reporting it to Netflix or Nvidia. It's been driving me crazy for a while now, so I'm glad I've figured it out. All of my friends are able to reproduce it, so I don't believe it's just me. Additionally, looking at the same episode via other sources the issue doesn't occur, so it seems to be just via the official Netflix app or Edge.",

More about plotting on a good-mind strategy, any genres is welcome, (movie/tv series). I don\u2019t mind with political plot or in dystopian era. Does cobra kai has similar sense to it.

Season 2 has been taking too long IMO, only because I want more. \n\nBlack Mirror, hold on tight. It\u2019s like the twilight zone tv show but darker. Great show you can watch in any order. Episode 1 is intense, FYI.",

I do currently have a bunch of time on hand but I'm still in a stressful situation and would like something that takes me out of it in the evening - doesn't have to be spiritual or anything and I don't mind depressing shows per s\u00e9, as long as it's immersive.  \n\n\nSome shows that did that for me exceptionally well in the past are:  \nLost (by far the best for this kind of situation)  \nTwin Peaks  \nThe Wire  \nThe Killing  \nGame Of Thrones  \nThe Walking Dead (when I binged it S1-S5 approx. but I've read the comics and was super thrilled to get into the show)  \n\n\nOther shows I've already seen (some of which I'd rank higher than the ones above, but didn't meet that one criteria I'm looking for):Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, La Casa De Papel, Luther, Goliath, Dark, Stranger Things, Fargo, Peaky Blinders, (The Walking Dead), Fear The Walking Dead, The Leftovers (disappointed with this one, still a good show though), Chernobyl, Queen's Gambit, The Sopranos and some I probably forgot about already.\n\nI'm currently eyeing Ozark and The 100, but neither convinces me to start the binge immediately. I'd love some recommendations to check out. On Netflix would be great, but it's not a killer criterium.",

Queen's Gambit is world class and deserves to win every award this year.  The final episode is the best TV I have ever seen in my life.  I can watch it over and over.\n\nHilda ties with Mushishi (you can watch it on Hulu) as the best animated series ever made.  It'll suck you in no matter your age.  It has very profound, moving story arcs, and the characters all have episodes focused on them.  It's not just about Hilda.  The entire world is so fully fleshed out, it's a place you can wrap your mind around.  \n\nRussian doll is a mind bending rollercoaster ride with a trippy ending.  Episodes are short, you can easily binge it in one evening (about 3 hours total)\n\nDo Queen's Gambit and Hilda for sure.  You won't regret either.  Netflix has got to do more stuff like this, because there's nothing else on the service at that high level of quality.\n\nHope you find se.good stuff to watch!",

Or the ending is uncertain which keeps the audience watching more episodes. The Crown is historical fiction and based on the life of Queen Elizabeth but we know the queen is fine right now (as of writing). So where is the climax? Is there like one event in the queens life the show is building up-to? What is everything building upto? \n\nOr is The Crown just an inside look at how the royal family operates? Putting out fires wherever they pop up, not really building up-to anything but super interesting nevertheless?\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nTL;DR I feel like the crown is an excellent show that might not have a climax and it\u2019s discouraging me from watching more episodes.",

It's semi-autobiographical and the queen is still alive and well, so no amount of embellishing and building tension can truly convince you that everything isn't gonna turn out just fine in the end concerning her. And there's nothing abnormal about feeling a little disenchanted as a result of that. Some historical adaptations can get away with it a bit more because we weren't there in those days, for example The Tudors series. Personally, I avoided adaptations about WACO and the show Narcos because I had already watched many documentaries and read many articles about them long before those series were ever a thing. I also steered clear of most movies about 9/11. Not just because I thought it was somewhat tasteless that the industry jumped on a bandwagon to capitalize on such a tragedy so soon, but also because they aren't really offering anything you don't already know if you were alive and saw it all go down in real time. When you take the suspense out of something and replace it with predictability, it can make it much less interesting for you. Like you said. It can certainly still be interesting, perhaps intriguing getting a glimpse into a royal life, but without suspense, it can feel disenchanting.",

In the same vein, I\u2019m discouraged from watching anything about the coronavirus (Totally Under Control). If something cool came out about the recent drama/events surrounding Meghan Markel and the royal family, I would watch that because I think I could learn more about that series of events. I liked Narcos because it was before my time and based on something that I\u2019ve heard about and seen before but didn\u2019t really know anything about (Pablo Escobar).",

        "id": "klsyho",
        "text": "I generally prefer TV shows to movies. I don't like horror.\n\nHere are a list of TV shows I've watched and my quick rating of them. These are just my opinions, everyone will have different tastes. I outline my ratings for multiple reasons. \n\n- So you know which shows I've watched as to not recommend.\n\n- The ratings serve to show which shows I enjoy, so please recommend shows that are similar to the ones that I rated highly. \n\n- Same as number two, but reversed- maybe you'll take away a recommendation if we have overlapping tastes. \n\nNo direct spoilers involved, but I do list cancelations when I know about them and sometimes I comment on what parts of the show were good/bad including endings, without revealing specifics.\n\n#Action\n\n- Breaking Bad **(9/10)**\n\nBasically a classic.\n\n- The Umbrella Academy **(8.5/10)**\n\nSecond season was better than the first, and the first was already good! I don't know if they can keep topping it but worth the watch for now.\n\n- Stranger Things **(8/10)**\n\nGreat first season, but I see the show getting worse with each subsequent season. \n\n- The 100 **(7.5/10)**\n\nNew enemies become allies when there's a newer enemy. Rinse and repeat for 5 seasons. I stopped at season 6.\n\n- The Witcher **(7.5/10)**\n\nA bit overhyped by people who already wanted to watch it. Getting a sense of time and geography felt missing.\n\n- The Walking Dead **(7/10)**\n\nGreat at the start and it tampers off with the plot getting repetitive.\n\n- Jessica Jones **(7/10)**\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed it but I can see how it's not for everyone. Season 2 doesn't always make sense.\n\n- The Colony **(5/10)**\n\nI enjoyed the time watching it but the plot didn't have a lot of room for growth and it got canceled. \n\n- Merlin **(3/10)**\n\nEnding was bad. King Arthur was a brat undeserving of any kind of legacy. Wtf is this even?\n\n#Dramas\n\n- This Is Us **(10/10)**\n\nIf you like soapy dramas, watch this. You'll find a character you love. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like that genera.\n\n- Dirty John **(9/10)**\n\nLoved it. Based on true stories. Good dose of empathy and reality IMO. \n\n- Broadchurch **(9/10)**\n\nMurder mystery that relies more on plot and sleuthing than a draw to gore. Second season is good as well. \n\n- Afterlife **(9/10)**\n\nFunny and sad take on grief and depression. \n\n- Living with Yourself **(8.5/10)**\n\nEver wondered what the best version of yourself looks like? What would you be if you did everything right? Good concept done well.\n\n- Queen's Gambit **(8.5/10)**\n\nI'm glad it's only 10 episodes, this is exactly the kind of thing that needed to be longer than a movie, but not stretched over multiple seasons. \n\n- Black Mirror **(8.5/10)**\n\nSome episodes are better than others. \n\n- The End of The F***ing World **(8/10)**\n\nGreat show, strong second season tying into the first.\n\n- Better Call Saul **(8/10)**\n\nDon't expect Breaking Bad, but it's still great.\n\n- You **(8/10)**\n\nPretty good.\n\n- Jane the Virgin **(8/10)**\n\nA catholic virgin gets accidentally artificially inseminated. It's a love triangle/square/octagon depending on the season. It makes fun of telanovella tropes. Great at the start, the last season seemed a bit lazy. Soapy.\n\n- Insatiable **(7.5/10)**\n\nThe ending frames everything you've watched slightly differently without a plot twist. Good drama. It's about beauty pageants but they're the background to the drama. Soapy, kinda.\n\n- Orange is the New Black **(7.5/10)**\n\nUps and downs with the plot. While it was intended to be political, the reality of prison life is actually also very depressing, and considering this is drawn out over multiple seasons, it's actually kind of taxing to watch even if I enjoyed it.\n\n- Gilmore Girls **(7.5/10)**\n\nMy most rewatched show on Netflix. The more I watch it the less I like it, so I had to stop. I don't know that I'd recommend it unless you've started.\n\n- Suits **(7/10)**\n\nBetter in early and midseasons than the end. \n\n- Russian Doll **(6.5/10)**\n\nGroundhog day premise with an ending I didn't like. Good concept, not a huge fan.\n\n- Wentworth **(6.5/10)**\n\nOrange is the New Black but Australian. Less comedy. I'd cut the last season.\n\n- Dead to Me **(6/10)**\n\nWatch it if you have nothing else to watch. Kinda like Good Girls.\n\n- Outlander **(6/10)**\n\nInteresting concept but too much sadism for the type of romantic-drama it was.\n\n- Sherlock **(6/10)**\n\nI'm tired of the genius sociopath narrative, even though this was popular for it's time.\n\n- Good Girls **(6/10)**\n\nI liked the side characters more than the protagonist and the plot was a bit dry. But it's got some humour.\n\n- Virgin River **(5/10)**\n\nI enjoyed it more than my rating reflects, but I know it's not for everyone. The plot isn't strong. I think I'm unconsciously rating it higher because the wide open shots of nature made me feel nice while watching it.\n\n- Blackmirror Bandersnatch **(5/10)**\n\nFun to tinker with for 20 minutes to an hour, but a lot of the endings don't make sense. Constantly operating the remote detracts from enjoyment fast.\n\n- Sex Education **(5/10)**\n\nGood premise but as a woman in her mid20s, I felt out of place watching teenagers give each other sex advice. Some humour. I can't really conceptualize who the target audience is intended to be.\n\n- Glitch **(4/10)**\n\nA great concept butchered. Plotholes galore. Mixing science and magic for a confusing plot. It was canceled to boot so we don't get to have answers. Don't start watching.\n\n#Comedies/Sitcoms\n\n\n- BoJack Horseman **(10/10)**\n\nNo show has ever prompted me to look at my relationships with other people as much. Animated sitcom, not anime. Most of the comedy comes from animal puns.\n\n- Scrubs **(8/10)**\n\nIt was pretty funny and heartfelt at times. Some really great episodes. The will-they-won't they romance in it is kinda garbage, but that's not why I watched it.\n\n- Archer **(8/10)**\n\nSitcom. Relies on vulgarity, crassness and repetition for comedy but it's almost always fun.\n\n- The Good Place **(7.5)**\n\nI'm actually currently watching it. Seems like a feel good comedy for the most part.\n\n- Santa Clarita Diet **(7.5/10)**\n\nOff-beat comedy with zombies. Lots of gore but not in a scary way. Probably the best zombie comedy, but it got canceled, so without an ending and some answers to questions, I can't give it a higher rating even though I really want to.\n\n- The Office **(7/10)**\n\nAn intentionally banal sitcom that replaces the classical laugh track with the main character staring deadpan into a camera. It's got some cringe, it's got some great punchlines. The plot and characters are ok. It's good but it's not great.\n\n- Friends **(5.5)**\n\nA bit nostalgic since I was growing up with my parents watching it. I don't have anything specifically positive to say about it, and that's the show's biggest problem.\n\n- How I Met Your Mother **(4/10)**\n\nCouldn't even finish. About a guy who loves love more than the women he supposedly loves. Like Friends, I don't think this would be funny without a laugh track. \n\n------------------\n\nHappy to chat about ratings as long as it's civil. I suspect the How I Met Your Mother rating will ruffle some feathers.\n\nBased on what I've watched and what I enjoyed, what would you recommend?\n\nI will likely not enjoy horror, reality TV, kids stuff or anime.\n\nI'm iffy about crime or medical shows because they usually seem like long investments that don't pay off as well as other shows. Definitely open to fantasy or sci fi, but I won't start things like star trek that will take forever.",

It was meh. \n\nModern Family is another one that I really enjoyed. \n\nI started to watch The Good Place but it didn't catch my interest after about 4 episodes. Perhaps I should give it another go, as I'm currently looking for something to watch.",

                "comment_text": "Maniac- similar in tone to Russian Doll, some of the overarching techy themes are similar to Black Mirror, but overall a really original and beautiful show. Set in an alternate (and very 80s-esque) timeline New York City, two individuals (Jonah Hill and Emma Stone) join the same trial for an experimental drug. Each episode has a contained story in a new setting as part of the drug trial, but the through-lines of relationships, the pasts of each character, and the people running the drug trial are amazing. Sometimes campy, sometimes creepy, always very emotionally real, funny, and inventive. One of my favorite shows.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend- Great comedy if you liked the earlier seasons of Jane the Virgin. A high-powered NYC lawyer with mental health issues drops everything to move to small-town California to pursue her teenage crush. The songs are hilarious and it satirizes the rom-com and musical tropes in a similar manner to how early Jane the Virgin treats telenovela tropes. A good mix of smart comedy and honest plot.\n\nArrested Development- Final two seasons really fall off but the first three are some of the best sitcom episodes ever. A formerly wealthy family has to move into a model home together after their father gets sent to prison. The one sane family member has to try and keep everything afloat while dealing with his ridiculous siblings and parents. One of the funniest shows out there, great use of narration.\n\nGLOW- One of the most underrated Netflix Originals (imo). Based around the true story of a female wrestling group in the 80s. A real ensemble comedy, every character is so fleshed out and interesting and they all get their moment. Very diverse, especially considering the time period it\u2019s set in. Super fun and quick to watch.\n\nDerry Girls- Set in Northern Ireland during the troubles. Sometimes feels similar to Sex Education and TEOTFW (maybe just because they all have UK teens), but much lighter and less raunchy. Just a genuinely funny show.\n\nI Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson- Absolutely ridiculous sketch show. Consistently funny and sometimes surreal.\n\nFeel Good- Very quick watch, good mix of sharp comedy and human drama. About the relationship between a lesbian standup battling addiction and her girlfriend who\u2019s never dated women before. Good queer relationship dynamics without the conflict of the show being centered on the fact that the characters are queer.",

The costuming is great and does a nice job of borrowing from the period while not underwhelming the actors. The chess is pretty accurate. \n\nSo, let\u2019s break down the rest. Jolene is a token character who did her job. The movie isn\u2019t a out Jolene and were her role more realistic, the conversation and criticism would\u2019ve overwhelmed the narrative. \n\nThe narrative is a female Bobby Fisher. Fortunately, one doesn\u2019t need a real life female chess grandmaster to pattern after, but in that area, while a men\u2019s game, it was not a men\u2019s only club. Just as sciences and engineering are dominated by men today, there are still women who work and compete and are equal to men in every aspect of every industry. This was true in chess as well. \n\nI\u2019m guessing, as I\u2019m currently reading the book, that Walter Tevis was, in part, putting on display the problems often associated with genius in a highly focused area with the use of drugs and alcohol as a medium of humanizing Beth while also acting as an illustrative example of what one who is self-destructive goes through. \n\nCould Tevis have chosen a man? Sure. Would it have worked as well? Probably not. The first step was to insist upon a suspension of disbelief and then to allow for an orphan to rise up and stand out. There are supporting characters, again of which Jolene is one, who support that journey as well as the transformations and transitions. More to the point, the show goes to great lengths to illustrate men who have gone the path we watch Beth follow. \n\nWhere is it all meant to lead us? \n\nWhat\u2019s unfortunate is the need for everything the represent every possible scenario in a way that feels good today. While uncomfortable, the show helps us to see the inequalities in the modern world as well as in the United States right now. That you cannot accept Beth as a possible grandmaster in the 1960s would further suggest you don\u2019t understand the movements of the era, equal rights, civil rights, and the explosion of sexual equality. \n\nYou\u2019re not required to like the series or the book or what it represents. But even a passive observer of the show should\u2019ve seen even older examples of women who competed at the highest levels of chess. \n\nFor me, the show is a nice, even, slow burn that satisfies in a way few movies or tv shows do. But that\u2019s me. And my take on history is not yours.",

                "comment_text": "This show made little sense to me. Externally, Elizabeth is motivated to win chess because she wants/needs money. Internally, she likes to be good at something, wants to feel in control. There's a tiny bit of backstory/context, and we're also supposed to presume that as a prodigy, she was quite bored by most all else life could offer her as a child at an orphanage. And yet, her character stops transforming after childhood.\n\nShe meets people and has her first sexual experience, but it doesn't change her. She starts doing other drugs and drinking, but it doesn't change her. Her mother dies, but it doesn't change her. She gets that nice guy to live with her, and for a moment there are hints that she may be receiving something she needs from him, but when she pushes him away and he leaves, there is no response or change in direction. My willful suspension of disbelief stretches far enough to cover this alternate reality in which chess is the most exciting thing ever, but not nearly far enough to make me believe Elizabeth as a character.\n\nNot to mention, I forgot, losing money she bet doesn't seem to bother her. There is no conflict at her own frivolous spendings, despite us being told of her being motivated to play, in part, for money, and having grown up as someone who had nothing. She NEEDS to win the $100 and not the $25 in her first tournament, etc. And the building blocks of her internal motivation don't hold up either. She gains enough life experience to be able to relax and let go, to welcome a loss, for example, because she realizes she has a place outside of the chess board in the world now. But her relationship to chess remains static.\n\nThere is so much more to say, honestly. At the end of the day, this isn't an action thriller, a series of sequential chess tournaments is not enough \"plot\" to distract from the fact that the character isn't changing, and this is something the writers must have been aware of thanks to a sprinkling of many events that have the POTENTIAL to transform her--but don't (with no explanation/it doesn't feel like her NOT changing was the intention).\n\nAnd unrelated, but I also noticed when her adopted mom sent her to buy three packs of cigarettes, she only got one (but returned home with three). And when she went to play late-night speed chess, it looked like the guy that was supposed to get her coffee didn't actually take the cup out of her hand (but she's seen without a cup after that).\n\nA lot of these Netflix Originals are the equivalent of fast food. They have tried to milk the motif of chess into a plot, but it doesn't hold up. The premise just isn't executed in a believable manner--what if an orphan girl child prodigy shook up 1960s world of chess? Well, okay! Where are the consequences?! What are the conflicts this child has to face? What does she lose? What does she gain? It would be so much more interesting if these questions were truly answered. I can't help but think of the contrast between the execution of this story and Rain Man, which to me has an equivalent premise. Of course, the story of Rain Man is holistically born OF the premise, rather than being tacked onto it. \n\nOtherwise, good acting, good costumes, entertaining scenes/visuals for the most part.",

                "comment_text": "SPOILERS:\n\nFor me, the biggest problems were that there was no chararacter arc in the story and all the chess lingo, professional chess player behaviour and the bord action that sucked big time for me as a chess enthusiast\n\nLets start with the chess stuff:\n\n1 Like, Harmon is supposed to be this Paul Morphy kind of player but that style of chess died 50 years before she took the stage and there is a reason Mikhail Tall was only a champion for 1 year even though his style is somewhat similar to that of Beth Harmon. It's fucking hard to attack, attack, attack against chess grandmasters! They know how to defend and counter threats on the chess board! \n\n2. Moscow tournament didn't make any sense because if Borgov was a WC he would not play in the candidate tournament because that's the place other challengers go to fight for the chance to play the WC.\n\n3. Chess grandmasters are always talking about basic tacticts and strategies. \"You do that and he doubles your pawns\" Really?? You got to say that to an aspiring chess WC contender? Hard to imagine Spassky would need such advice because the guy was probably thinking 3000 levels deeper than that. \n\n4. Throwing kings as a sign of resining is also a cringy \"only in films\" type of move, real chess players never do that. \n\n5. Banter during games is sooo bad, players do not even look at each other during games, let alone converse. Kasparov is an exception. \n\n6. No draws, ever. It doesn't even come up until the final episode that that is also a regular thing that happens in chess. \n\nAs far as the story goes here are a couple of my questions that i feelt were not answerd:\n\n\n1. Why is her mom insane and why didn't she try to contact her real dad when she got more older in an effort to find out more?\n\n\n2. Is Townes gay? What's up with that whole story line?\n\n\n3. Why bring back Harry Beltick, the guy we see in one scene for 15 seconds 4 episodes ago? Like, he is such a vanilla dude and i don't see what the fuck he brings to the table story wise.\n\n\n4. Mr. Scheibel, the most important person in her life after her mother is a completely forgotten chararacter all the way up to the last episode.\n\n\n5. Joylen, the token black bff, also gone. But let's watch Harry Beltick's pale limp dick get screen time talking absolut chess  nonsense, his aspirations and dental problems.\n\n\n6. Does she want to be an extravagant Parisian model or a down-to-earth sort of girl that plays chess with old men in the park? I don't get it.\n\n\n7. What's up with her not taking money from the church ladies? Is she secretly communist? I mean i wouldn't mind it, just fucking explain it please so it's not just that \"i am a hard nose bitch that aint doing nothing if i don't 100% agree with it\" like, you need the money girl, say whatever is needed, get the bag and fly to fucking Moscow. \n\n\nOn the plus side, really liked the costumes, production design and the cinematography,  it's an ok show for waisting time i guess",

The character of Jolene was so cringe.  Did the pilot not test well because it was too white so they wrote her in?  The conversation about her being the guardian angel was so problematic.  Also her lending her $3,000 is absolutely ridiculous.  No way. How could the writers be this lazy?\n\nSomething I haven't heard anyone else mention is WHY THE FUCK IS HARRY IN BENNY'S NYC APT TALKING OVER CHESS STRATEGY FOR MOSCOW???\n\nHarry is a student/grocery store assistant manager IN KENTUCKY.  Benny had no idea who Beth was in Vegas after she beat Harry and won the Kentucky championship, and she has novelty because she is THE ONLY STUNNING REDHEAD IN THE ROOM, so there's no evidence Benny would have any idea who Harry was.

What is more, and has already been said here, her character's psychological evolution is so linear and underdeveloped that a great opportunity for understanding the roots of addiction or the colors of neurodivergence are missed completely....\n\nit just creates the overall impression that chess is easy if you are a genius but that being genius will also make you a selfish  unpleasant addict",

This wasn't that. I thought the show did good work dramatizing the chess and keeping it interesting. I would have wished they showed the board a bit more, so that you could actually see the moves properly and follow the game at least momentarily. I feel like ranting about the chess style being from a wrong timeline or people communicating over the board is just... well, it's not a documentary but a dramatization - it made the games more interesting. If you feel that the liberties it took in chess were too much, then thats fine but I strongly disagree. I'm the type of person who watches Top Gun: Maverick and doesn't give a shit that the mission they do wouldn't actually be done in that way but with some missile strike or whatever.\n\nToken black character - I'm honestly SO tired of this bullshit. If there are 0 black people in a show, it's racist. If there's one, it's a token. If there's more, that's unrealistic for the time and it will feel forced. The adoptive mom even said: only people your age who work are coloured. It was a (more) racist time, like get over it. I thought the character of Jolene was really good and the way she reappeared long after the childhood scenes was really nice.\n\nIn fact that's one of the biggest parts I liked about the show: the beginning in the facility where she was, was dark and powerful and it was kind of quickly forgotten and you got used to her being an older and attractive, independent woman. Then later on you get these reminders of the childhood times and it felt really nostalgic even to the viewer and you felt like Harmon, you had forgotten about it and now it feels so important (Jolene, and the guy who taught Harmon chess in the basement).\n\nI thought the relationships were nicely portrayed. She didn't have the love of her life, there were these different guys who she sometimes very minorly sparked with and it was ambiguous if they were into her and how seriously. That's realistic. I felt like it was very natural and something that represented real life unusually well.\n\nLast thing, draws did come up earlier than last episode. Up to the later parts of the series she was winning everyone anyways, but she did mentioned drawing against some players when talking to her adoptive mom. But you're right that they didn't happen maybe as often as they do in real life but big deal",

On the one hand, you have the positive and caring male figures in her life, such as the janitor at the orphanage; on the other, you have both her biological father and her adoptive father deserting her; and in the middle you have a few guys she's either attracted to or using, one of whom is apparently gay, one of whom is a well-meaning dork who moves out because he can't seem to handle a very low-level disagreement (but who later returns out of concern over Beth's addiction); and another who wears a leather jacket everywhere and who is the only guy she actually enjoys having sex with, but whom she says she doesn't love and who pisses her off by wanting to talk about chess in bed (you'd think she wouldn't mind that).  Oh, and there are a pair of identical twins that for some inexplicable reason make her adoptive cougar mother hot.  \n\nAnd they all make a reprise at the end in Benny's apartment, along with a few other dudes that we met in passing.  \n\n\nSo ... how is the relationship to men theme resolved in the series?  In a kind of Hallmark Channel way where everything somehow works out and everybody becomes good friends, that's how.  \n\n\nI, too, Googled, searching for criticism of this series and wondering if I was the only one who didn't like it, and I found a *New Yorker* article that was critical - but the only real criticism in that *New Yorker* piece as that the actress playing Beth was too good looking and could not play the desperation that the novel's Beth feels.  But I think that critique barely scratches the surface.",

The show and everything in it is three years old. \n\nSomehow you missed:\n\n> Jolene is a token character who did her job. \n\nWhich, maybe, was easy to miss. You, however, have one post (and quite a few comments) on Reddit. Your post isn\u2019t a year old, yet and states you\u2019ve started a business because: racism. \n\nGreat. Right there I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to take the side of someone who doesn\u2019t agree with tokenism in literature or entertainment and feels the need to interject in past discussions rather than to introduce or engage in new discussions. \n\nGood on ya, mate. \n\nHowever, your point adds nothing, changes nothing, and establishes yourself as difficult. None of such is out of line, per se, as this is an anonymous forum full of people from different backgrounds discussing often inane things. \n\nWhat you clearly don\u2019t seem to grasp, outside of age of content, is that your opinion, while valid for you, is irrelevant and amounts to noise. Jolene was and will always remain (via Netflix) a token character. Incidentally, a token character that didn\u2019t need to exist at all. \n\nOf cast the cast is dominantly white. In case you missed this, somehow, between history and watching TV and movies, and in so many other ways, in the United States white is still the dominant skin color and in the 1960s, even during the height of the civil rights movement, it was even more so. \n\nWhether or not this is intended to be revisionist or alternate history, the nature of entertainment is to reflect the demographics of the intended audience. To be fair, though, not enough is being done to balance this. Even now. Definitely not then. Therefore, a story about white folk in a part of the country that is dominantly white in neighborhoods that are white and institutions (the orphanage) that would\u2019ve been all white, you\u2019re demanding more anachronistic judgement and anachronistic insertions of equality and duality.\n\nThat\u2019s fine. I get that. But to insert your *opinion* as though it is either new or unspoken or unaddressed and as though it has any real impact on anything, other than to get a commenter to engage three years later, is about the extent to which you\u2019re going to engage anyone. \n\nStand up against racism, I\u2019m right there with you. Call out Hollywood for not doing more, I\u2019ll sign the petition. But trying to insert anything into this as new or important and more than your ego at play and you lost me. Because any demand that requires everyone to be represented in all places and at all times, especially in entertainment, is irrational, impossible, and you\u2019ll never be able to support the argument in any meaningful, non-emotional way.",

A lot of TVs only have a certain port that supports HDCP 2.2 (required for 4K).\n\nYour TV app disregards HDCP because it's built in and you should be able to get Dolby Vision/4k (You'd get BOTH, but you'd only see \"Dolby Vision\" badging on the title) on a title like Our Planet, assuming your bandwidth can handle it.",

        "id": "jx5q2v",
        "text": "Queens Gambit is my absolute favorite show this year, and felt that it was so incredibly filled with important lessons that I had to make a post (and a video) discussing these very lessons. I'm a mental and performance coach, training people to be the most confident, resilient, and effective versions of themselves in overcoming their obstacles and accomplishing their most challenging goals. I'm going to discuss concepts I saw in the show, and my reaction to the series.\n\n*I want this post to add value independent of my video link. If linking in this context is still not allowed, please let me know and I'll take it out.*\n\nLet's go over some lessons from Beth's journey (and character traits, too). The video is more comprehensive.\n\n**Video: \"The Genius of Queen's Gambit\"**: [https://youtu.be/a3WG6dqkoJ0](https://youtu.be/a3WG6dqkoJ0)\n\n**1. Beth's curiosity and commitment are strong qualities that get her ahead in life**. When she gets intrigued by chess, she immediately latches onto it. More importantly, she continues to pursue it long after the honeymoon period is over. This is a lesson/reminder that as we get more and more of our human impulses satisfied faster than ever, love and passion for a craft manifests into a skill over **time**. So, we have to remember to kindle the curiosity, be patient, and commit for as long as possible. The longer you can stay curious about your craft, the deeper you'll go.\n\n**2. Beth is incredibly creative in how she practices her craft.** Her use of visualization and imagination to play chess is an incredible feat of obsession and determination. Constantly thinking and pondering about playing chess is a huge strength- and something you can definitely do without drugs (I get it, she does rely on it for most of the show). So learn to be creative in how you approach your interests; don't just give up if there's a little resistance (like no chess board in front of you). Make sure your obsession is worth it (won't bankrupt you, is not detrimental to your health or well being). Clear out time in your day to just think and theorize about ways you can learn and improve.\n\n**3. Beth self reviews her chess games, which is key to competitive growth**. This allows her to identify her blind spots, recognize mistakes, and learn quicker- not only from her own games, but from others' games. It also helps her be process-oriented, as the result of a past game is long gone. In your own life, review your own processes and do self-reflection. Get feedback from your own point of view, and also other people. This includes those who think differently than you, and have different backgrounds. Ensure that your actions on a day-to-day level map to your goals. This will put you on the right path to succeed, regardless of what your goal is.\n\n**4. Hard work unlocks talent**. Otherwise, talent is just a bare head start. Beth constantly reads and studies different chess games from books, magazines, and any other outlet she can find. While she has an admittedly incredible gift, she also works hard to make something out of it. There are plenty of talented people who never get anywhere because of a lack of hard work- and hard work is something you can control. We all know this- so what should we remember? Don't coast on your talents (or more applicable, your recent or past success). Focus only on consistently improving (regardless if slow and gradual), and learn to love the work. The work is the only thing you truly control.\n\n**5. Learn to cherish your relationships**. Beth doesn't have a lot of consistent people in her life; she's constantly traveling and her friends are from all different places. If you haven't reached out to your friends or family recently, do so. Especially in 2020, going into 2021. You don't have to be close to every single one; just check in on them. The people that you do have are very valuable (which Beth learns as an orphan).\n\n**My thoughts on actors, production**:\n\n* EVERY single actor played their role incredibly well. Their use of facial expressions to make chess games exciting should be a master class in acting.\n* All of the hair styles, design, sets, colors, etc. were so perfectly done that I felt fully immersed in the 1950s-1960s.\n* The music is absolutely spectacular. I've been listening to it when I work, as well as during the 1 week it took me to edit this video (I have a job and coach).\n\nFor my full detailed breakdown all of Beth Harmon's strengths, weaknesses, and journey- check out my video. Would love any feedback as well, it's the most editing-intensive video I've done in a long time.",

This show was really really interesting in it's approach to a subject that could have been done so poorly.\n\nA few other things I'll add that I appreciated:\n\n* Positive depiction of men losing to a woman. It would have been extremely easy to slip into a \"men being sore losers after being beaten by a woman\" stereotype given the time period in a predominately male dominated sport. They threw a few of these into the mix but I really like how the last episode focused on how well these masters lost to her and genuinely respected her win.\n* Pretty balanced approach to her sexuality. I appreciated that they didn't shy away from this as it feels very easy to paint \"prodigies\" as relentlessly focused on their particular talent and not driven by anything else. The show blends her relationships and sexuality very well while never really making a overt statement about it.\n\nOne thing I thought could have been done a bit better:\n\n* Addiction is a big focus in the early episodes and then kind of just goes away in later episodes. It feels like we are just supposed to feel like she \"willed\" her addiction away but it feels like a tough pill to swallow (pun intended).\n\nOverall this was a really great series and I hope the folks that worked on it get to do more work in the near future.",

I grew up thinking, \"oh, I have a question about this, so it must not be for me.\" It wasn't until I became an adult and found that if I want to move forward with anything, I need to constantly ask questions and pursue knowledge or I will fall flat. \n\nBeth's first tournament was one of my favorite sequences because she asked about everything: ranking, seating, time clocks, grandmasters, and Las Vegas. She left that day with so much new knowledge and zero judgement. It was the most realistic example of learning I have ever seen in a TV program or movie.",

I completely agree, I think a lot of movies skip over the progression and don't really make the character REACHING a point of success cathartic enough.\n\nI love that you mentioned how inquisitiveness and that is a huge reason she gets so far. even back when she talks to mr shaibel it's all questions until she can get more understanding of the game. and frankly, i'd guess it's also a great predictor of success in academics & all sorts of different fields. Maybe I'll make a video in the future on the topic of inquisitiveness.\n\nThanks so much for the thoughts and if you have any suggestions for topics or feedback on how I can improve, let me know :) have a great day",

        "text": "I just finished watching the Queen's Gambit and absolutely loved it. But there is a detail that never quite sat right with me and I wonder if anyone else has written about or explored this idea.\n\nThe car accident that Beth survives doesn't make any sense. She was in the back seat of the car. in the 1950s. She is wearing no discernable seat belt... Maybe she had a two-point seat belt, as if that would do anything to protect her. She was in a head-on collision with another vehicle travelling in the opposite direction that immediately killed the mother. In the only image of the accident that the series shows, Beth is seen in the foreground in front of the wrecked vehicles WITHOUT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON HER. From that moment on it is taken for granted that this accident is the true cause of her mother's death and the reason for her being orphaned.\n\nThis show isn't about superheroes with magical powers. It is about a chess prodigy leaving in a plausible alternative universe where instead of Bobby Fischer taking on the Soviets in chess it is a young redheaded orphan girl. The psychological tone of the story is so well realized that I can't help but think that the unbelievability of Beth surviving the car accident ISN'T lazy writing. I think that the story of her mother's death is one that Beth made up to quell her own feelings of abandonment. It is another layer to the story that speaks to the reality (or lack thereof) of the events depicted in the series. After all, the POV for the series is Beth Harmon's. I don't think this means that every event in the show as a whole is necessarily unreliable as it is in The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I do think that it is meaningful that the accident itself is never depicted on the show. We the audience never see the two cars collide with one another. And in storytelling, if you don't see something, then you can't know exactly what happened.\n\nMaybe her mother did die in the accident. Maybe Beth tells herself, and even believes, that she was in the car. But there is NO WAY that Beth actually survived the car accident as it is described on the show.\n\nThoughts?",

Forgot about it. Until watching this series. Just ordered a chess set.\n\nThe thing I remember most about chess was that anticipation, like not knowing what way they will go, planning the possibilities, and the planning your responses. And other small things...like making it look like you\u2019re moving a specific way/line of attack, but secretly working on something else behind the scenes. The game is so much more fun than people give it credit for.",

I remember chuckling at beth\u2019s little act of rebellion against him (trying to be as spoiler free as possible here) and how several episodes down the line it pays off unexpectedly in a way that both illuminated and enhanced a character who basically was in all of three scenes in a seven episode production. That sort of attention to detail I think is what sets this series apart from most any other limited series I\u2019ve seen of late. It\u2019s one of the best tv productions of the decade, imo (and it\u2019s been a very good decade for tv productions!)\n\nAlso, the last episode could have flat out been a stand alone movie. It was brilliantly executed.",

It's supposed to help imbue character and also subvert our expectations.  \n\nI actually found it kind of refreshing that she didn't stay a mousy, virginal girl with a traumatic past who just happened to be really, really good at chess.  That would've been boring.  Why couldn't she like chess, AND like to dress fashionably?  Does it have to be one or the other?  If so, that's rather limiting, and also wouldn't make the character have as much of an impact, considering its time period.  For me, as a woman who personally has many \"quirky\" interests but also likes to dress up, I found it to be realistic, and more so, empowering.  \n\nAlso refreshing was the fact that while it's been marketed as an \"addiction\" story, the truth is...it is, and it isn't.  She's someone who never dealt with her past because of life's constant hard knocks, and as such, developed some unhealthy coping mechanisms along the way.  She is isn't violent or abusive, just self-destructive the way we all might be at various points.  A lot of her issues were internal.  It gave us the right amount of time it needed to tell us that, yes, Beth is partial to drink and drugs\u2014and at the story's peak moment, when she is at her lowest, she will break and use both weaknesses to cope.  In this sense, I don't think it was heavy-handed at all.",

Then, flour got added to the list of ingredients that were hard to buy.   \n\nAnd now, we have over 85,000 members, all trying to answer basic questions...how do I make a starter?  What\u2019s wrong with my starter?  How do I keep a starter? \n\nAt the same time, there was the release on Netflix of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, which talks about the universality of bread.  Combine that with the release of the news that the guy who started a tech company also had a project involving reviving yeast from vessels excavated in Egyptian tombs.  \n\nI started baking sourdough when I realized that commercial bread upset my stomach.  Luckily, I started about a year before COVID, so I was able to help, at a time when bread mentors were not yet overwhelmed, and learned via Messenger.  Since then, I have mentored bakers from California, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, and talked technique with bakers from all over the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating topic, and the bread is incredibly delicious.  However, it is both an art and a science, and takes quite some time to have success, as opposed to using commercial yeast, which is predictable.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like to try, I\u2019d like to help!",

I was more focused on the story being told than the chess matches.   \n\n\nMy son loves chess and decided a few months ago to start learning Russian, so I told him that while the scenes where Russian is spoken are brief, he could still learn something new by watching. He's still at an age where sexual content in media is something he wants to avoid, but I thought the scenes that included that content were relatively tame. This series felt like it was made in the era it was set in. I really appreciated that about it.   \n\n\nI've been recommending this to everyone I know.",

It was good that Harry Beltik showed up again, thought after the 6th episode that he would not come back. The best scene at the end was definitely the phone call where she was presented all the possible moves and their solutions - it had something of Harry Potter meeting the people of 'Dumbledore's Army' for the first time.\n< \n\nAltogether it was simply good and her look was amazing.",

He would have been analysing them very hard.\n\nIt was common practice with adjournments to seal an unusual move, just so that the opponent would waste time analysing variations that would not occur on the board.    Adjournments died out when computers became strong, as it was seen as unfair. Now games are played to a finish in one session with a speeded up time limit.\n\nI used to hate adjournments with a passion.  In the London league they used to seal after only 30 moves, which meant many games, and would have to travel all the way in to bishopsgate just to finish the game, it also meant having to spend hours studying the position, which as a student was a bit of a time hog.",

        "text": "I enjoyed the theme of chess (as a chess player myself), I enjoyed the setting, and I enjoyed the plot - as far as the destructive nature and the proverbial \"curse of genius\".\n\nThe acting was very bland - asside from\u00a0Marielle Heller\u00a0(the mother),\u00a0Thomas Brodie-Sangster\u00a0(Benny), and\u00a0Anya Taylor-Joy\u00a0(even thought where some very flat deliveries). Every other actor was so monotone and flat.\n\nThe writing was fine, up to the point where it came to Capablanca's intuitive chess style came into question. Beth out of nowhere becomes and advocate of intuitive chess? She's shown throughout the series studying various patterns and algorithms. Reading multiple pattern-based books, discecting games, and replaying games with her \"imagination\". That's anything but intuition - it's memorization.\n\nAnd after training with Benny, she... goes back to pattern based chess?\n\nI'm not saying it's not normal for a chess player to change their style, but maybe make it a point? It just felt like a trope to make her feel more like Bobby Fischer (he's notorious for dissing modern chess and it's algorithmic style), or an excuse for them to have a developmental story between Benny and Beth.\n\nDecent series, but definitely nowhere near as \"perfect\" as everyone seems to make it out to be.\n\nI just don't understand the hype.",

Would've much preferred if they went down the route of the real world where at the super high GM level there's bitter rivalries and hatred and toxicity, because really the people who get to that level playing a board game aren't typically healthy/social personalities. So having all her past/current rivals and ex-lovers suddenly team up for her benefit (whether or not she's facing Cold War opponents) just seemed too Hollywood.\n\nThe rest of the show was good though. I don't particular agree with your criticism on the acting, I think they got that right, chess is a nerdy antisocial world and you're probably not going to find lively happy people in a downtrodden religious orphanage. Seemed quite realistic. I guess they were going for a bleak depressing tone hence the \"bland\" performances.",

Here is what I can recommend:\n\nAlice in Borderland - Sci-fi/horror thriller centered on completing deadly games in a depopulated Tokyo. Warning: you may be mentally and psychologically tortured by the body count.\n\nYu Yu Hakusho - Live-action adaptation of the classic manga. Despite lasting only five episodes (at least so far), it boasts brutal, hard-hitting fights that will keep you agitated.\n\nThe Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House - Very relaxing slice-of-life show about two teenage girls who wish to become geiko (geisha as they are called in Kyoto). One blossoms into a premier prospect, while the other instead pivots into being a cook. Best seen after finishing one or both of the first two.",

I am using Canada Netflix.\n\nI liked:\n\n-Ginny and Georgia - it was dark, romance and I guess suspense and emotional \n-Virgin River - the romance aspect was good and it had emotional moments\n\nWatched some of them haven\u2019t either caught or finished:\n-Sweet magnolias, on my block, nobody wants this,\nGood girls,Inventing Anna, Queen of Gambit, Stranger Things\n\nplease don\u2019t recommend me anything that\u2019s slow when it comes to romance and also no nudity in like private parts. Some of these Netflix shows has nudity in it and I want to avoid seeing any private parts.",

The things they change are interesting, the twists left untwisted until just the right moment, the leads are\u2026 I mean\u2026 SO incredibly talented. And Sam Reid as Lestat is a fucking VISION. He\u2019s also a self-described Anne Rice nerd who wore a cape and fangs while growing up on a farm in Australia. His portrayal of an otherworldly, ancient, French psycho killer Vampire is just incredible. You\u2019ll love it. EVERYONE will love it.

It's a story about war and how horrible it is, but you learn to love the characters and their stories along the way. I have seen it many times and enjoy it every time I do. \n\nThe Pacific - Again, HBO production but on Netflix. Basically Band of Brothers but on the Pacific Theater of WWII. \n\nMindhunter - Fantastic Netflix show about the FBI discovering and classifying what serial killers are. Very disappointed it got cancelled because one of my favorite shows. \n\nStranger Things - Netflix. Paranormal show about high school kids fighting the forces of evil. The show is better than it sounds. \n\nThe Expanse - Sci-Fi show on Prime Video based on a series of novels. \n\nThe Good Place - Netflix - A feel good, lighthearted, and funny show that explores humanity, morality, and the concept of heaven and hell. Honestly one of the best series finales ever. I think it ends perfectly and has a strong message about choice, life, and what it all means - up there with Breaking Bad for best series finale of all time. This is my go-to show to put on when I'm going to bed at night (kind of like the office for many). It's just a comfortable show. Shorter episodes though.",

That first episode and you will be binging it so hard.  Dude is in a restaurant, heads to the restroom... comes back to his table and his life has been erased.  It's amazing.  They went 2 seasons but I think it finished a bit abruptly.\n\nPerson of Interest is probably the best series from start to finish.  That first episode is gold and the ending 5 seasons later is nearly perfect.  If you don't know anything about Jim Caviezel do yourself a favor and don't look him up until after you have finished the series.  Caviezel the person is horrible.  John Reese the character he played is perfection.\n\nIf you want a short 3 episode SciFi series to binge and you can find it, The Lost Room is so good!

I'm stuck in a low-paying job, eager to work hard and succeed, but stressed about my future. I've found solace in films/series with characters who are:\n\n- Super focused\n- Work in isolation/alone\n- Relentless in their pursuit of success\n\nSome examples that have motivated me so far:\n\n- Nightcrawler\n- Whiplash\n- Taxi Driver\n- Dexter series\n- Queen Gambits\n\nPlease suggest more movies/series that fit this theme! I need a boost to keep pushing forward.\n\nThanks in advance for your recommendations!\n\nEdit: Adding more context - I'm open to different genres, but leaning towards psychological thrillers/dramas.",

It's a bit teen-leaning sometimes but it's some of the more compelling drama to come out of the CW. \n\n3% is another one on Netflix, though it's not in English, if that deters you. \n\nTo me, part of what makes something binge-able is immersion, but mostly a good plot twist and cliffhanger.

Additionally, the queens gambit also have a really great character dynamic, i love beth relationship with people close to her and how you can feel each of the characters personality in the show even if you only saw them a couple of minutes in each episode.\n\nThat\u2019s also what i really like about haikyuu, you basically able to sympathize with everyone because how good the characters writing is in both of those shows.\n\nThe character doesn\u2019t have to be born gifted like Beth Harmon but it would be a plus if they are. \n\nSo do you guys have movies or shows recommendations that you think i should try out?",

It's planned from the start to be a one-season deal, generally no extra seasons tacked on. Unlike those never-ending series that keep you hooked for years",

When it was revealed 10 minutes into the first episode, the reason Beth was in the orphanage, I was crying so hard I had to pause it and walk around the house and calm down. Then, when Beth's adoptive mother volunteered to stake her chess tournies, I'm glad the show went in the direction it did instead of the mother being greedy. Truly a fantastic series, and ATJ deserves to be Hollywodd A-lister now.",

I think they should add a section that\u2019s just that. I think it would be different from the Popular Section because some of the extremely popular shows on Netflix (Ginny and Georgia, Bridgerton) just aren\u2019t for me but if I saw a show in the Most Liked Section I would be more likely to watch it. I\u2019m also curious as to what shows on there are on Netflix that the majority of people who watch them enjoy them (Lord of the Rings, The Hunger Games, Shadow and Bone, Wednesday, Lockwood and Co, Arcane, Avatar the Last Airbender, Haunting of Hill House, Queens Gambit, Sweet Tooth) are a couple that are Most Liked. I just think the Most Liked shows deserve their own little section Netflix",

But the reviews convinced me and actually, I quite enjoyed Season 2. It wasn't necessary for the show to continue, but it told a different kind of story that I appreciated in its own right. It's not as seamless as Season 1, like it doesn't all tie together as perfectly (and Alan's story isn't worked in as well), but I thought it was quite good and worth watching.",

                "comment_text": ">what anime would you suggest\n\nHmmm. **I would say Naoki Urasawa's \"MONSTER\"**. This is my go to anime for anyone who don't gravitate towards anime. It's 74 episodes, a frame for frame adaptation of the manga and it's fucking brilliant!. It's plot feels like something you would see in a western live action thriller (Edit: No wonder why!, I just looked it up. It was inspired by the original 1960 series \"The Fugitive\").  I jokingly call the series \"David Fincher's LOST\". Because it carries a very similar frame work of themes: light vs dark, good and evil, flashbacks exploring why a character is the way they are. Exploration of what makes a good or evil person. Whether people are capable of redemption. Is evil made or born?.\n\nYou combine that with a Fincher type investigation/period piece and a cat and mouse thriller that feels like it is taken straight out of Seven and you have one hell of a narrative that keeps you guessing all the way through (**I also suggest going in blind. Even a plot summary will give away spoilery information and the way the narrative slowly unfolds at the beginning is absolutely incredible and even more so if you're in the dark on anything**).\n\nI recommend watching it in Japanese with English subtitles. The english dub is pretty good. But I think the voice of the antagonist is WAY more creepy with his child like delivery in the sub, and the dub changes a lot of it's placement of music, making some scenes not land as well in the dub cause the music doesn't quite fit the moment.\n\n>I really enjoyed Erased\n\nThe live action version of that show wasn't too bad either. Having said that, I wasn't a huge fan of Erased. Mainly because it was so obvious who the villain was. They gave no red hearings at all and after the protagonist and his friends, they only introduced one character: and he was it!. Because there was no one else introduced it HAD to be him.",

Okay, hear me out.  BSG is for sci fi for people who are not in to sci fi (the showrunner hated \"Star Trek\" and created the show as the anti-trek lol). It's about the characters and relationships and real world stuff. This show was WAY ahead of it's time. The issues it brought up, going real deep in to the \"what is human\" and \"what it means to be human\". and the acting is incredible. The issues were so topical and \"real world\" that the United Nations even invited the cast and writers to host a panel discussing it's issues! (not a easy feat, one of the first and only times it's happened).  The way I would describe it is...Attack on Titan meets LOST...but in space (not to be confused with \"Lost in space\" lol).  It's currently streaming on \"Peacock\".  It starts off with the 3 hour mini series. Then the 4 seasons.\n\nRegarding the teen shows: Sex Education, Heartbreak High. They're both really good.",

William Zebreka really steals the show in this as Johnny with tons of throwback to his love for the 80s and his obliviousness to how times have changed. It\u2019s really well written and very funny. \n\nOther shows I\u2019d recommend are Ozark, very suspenseful and gripping drama.\n\nFor a mystery I\u2019d recommend Manifest. Go in blind and give it the time it needs. It will start picking up steam and really get your mind going. Also Netflix just picked up for a 4th season. \n\nThe crown. I am myself not in anyway interested in the royals like some people maybe. By i give this show a chance and was blown away with the production value, the sets are immaculate and the acting is top notch. The musical score that accompanies it as well is another power element to this show.",

Bloodline is a slow burn but so worth it, in the same vein as Ozark.\n\nEdited to add Black Mirror, but I usually recommend people to skip the first episode  of season 1 and come back to it later if they like the rest of the season. Each episode is a self contained story so you won't miss anything.",

I definitely wouldn't watch him in anything new. But I eventually thought that his crimes should not define my enjoyment of movies and shows, especially when it means missing out on so many other great performances from others. It was really hard to look at him but I think it was made easier by the fact that his character is so detestable.\n\nThis show is amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone.",

Based on your tastes, I would recommend:\n\n[**Russian Doll**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcKoAMGGvY) \\- bc you liked Dark (the mind-bending time travel, the layers upon layers and the philosophy) and Orange Is The New Black (the main character of Russian Doll is one of the stars of OITNB, also the series have a similar kind of dark sense of humor, are heart-wrenching yet life-affirming)\n\n[**All Of Us Are Dead**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN5TD4VRcSM) \\- bc you liked multiple zombie series, survival/apocalypse series and teen drama series. Particularly The Walking Dead and The 100.\n\n[**Schitt's Creek**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uWS6CnC2o)\\- bc you liked The Good Place. Unfortunately the trailer isn't very representative of the quality of the series. It doesn't have the fantasy element, but the main characters, character development and humor is similar. Also Schitt's Creek is the series I hear most mentioned/recommended on The Good Place sub (aside from TGP, ofc)\n\n[**3%** (I have to make this link larger with extra text)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yyzNQfaQR8) \\- bc you liked The 100\n\nThe series you listed are quite varied. It would help to know what kinds of things you feel like watching right now. Do any of the following descriptors sound appealing?:\n\nComedy (I'm guessing you're not big on comedy based on your list), drama, romance, coming-of-age, Young Adult/teen drama, costume drama, historical/period, fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, investigation, crime drama, thriller, dystopian, apocalyptic/survival, psychological, philosophical, feel-good/heartwarming, lighthearted, serious, gritty, brooding/noir, fast-paced, character-driven or plot-driven, witty dialogue, lots of action, etc etc add your own descriptors.",

        "text": "Holy. Shit. This one came out of no where for me. Not only don't I play League of Legends but as a Dota 2 player I've grown to be a blind hater of it. But holy shit. The Netflix animated series that explores the lore behind two of the most popular characters in the game is so absolutely mind blowing it gave me a newfound love for the world of League. To put things in perspective as to how impressed I am, I would say it totally stomps Dota 2's own Netflix animated series, Dota: Dragon's Blood released earlier this year, which is by all means a great execution in its own right. For starters, the art in Arcane is so uniquely cool and animated with motion capture and stunning vfx giving fans a real treat during fight and action scenes. Next, the plot.. it is as compelling as the world-building is unreal. I really hate comparing it to Dragon's Blood--which did a great job exploring the Dota 2 lore and doing justice to the heroes--but Arcane's storyline is just in another LEAGUE as it takes on a more political-crime-drama-esque approach that only gives it more depth and more room for character development. The script and voice acting is on point. Everything about it is top notch. Dude. One of the best entertainments I have ever consumed. I just feel like I'm sucked right in in the world of League. Did I mention the character design?\n  \nThis is Queen's Gambit caliber to me. Except it's based on a video game. On that pipeline we've had Castlevania and Dragon's Blood so far (that I know of). Neither comes close to the production level of Arcane. In fact it might be one of the few cases where the Netflix Adaptation is better than what it's adapting from. I'd be surprised if it's not received well even by non gamers. Netflix and Riot should be proud of this one.\n\nEdit: not to mention the music. gotta love the opening credits rolling to Imagine Dragons, who made a cameo in one of the episodes.",

There was something different about our connection from the first moment she jumped up on me. That was like 15 years ago and when I moved out of state I adopted my own shelter pitbull who was my best friend and companion the last 10 years. She saw me through my 20\u2019s and saved me in so many ways. She collapsed and died in my arms at her favorite park yesterday. I\u2019m completely empty and broken and I\u2019m not good at letting people console me but for some reason dumping it to a random person on Reddit seemed appealing to me right now. Anyways, thanks for having the username you do, cuz it brought a bit of warmth to my heart remembering sweet Penny who started my love of pitty\u2019s.\n\nPs. Arcane was awesome and my wife loved it too! We haven\u2019t played league of legends in years but we\u2019ve been recommending the show to friends who aren\u2019t gamers because it\u2019s just so well made.",

Looking for a new show we can watch that ideally has no romance/relationships as that can be pretty triggering right now. \n\nThe only shows we've been able to watch recently are Falcon & the Winter Soldier and Project Runway. Drama, action, adventure, mystery, etc are all welcome. Comedies can be hit or miss, so can reality shows.\n\nANY suggestions of shows you enjoyed that ideally don't have relationships/marriage/romance would be wonderful and much appreciated, though I know its pretty hard. \n\nShows we've seen in past years: stranger things, atypical, money heist, schitts creek, leftovers, the good place, sweet magnolias, dead to me, queens gambit, queer eye, ozark, big little lies, and lots others I can't think of.\n\nNot a big fan of true crime, horror, creepy stuff like that. \n\nThanks!",

There\u2019s a whole romantic subplot that isn\u2019t in the books\n\n\u2022 Avatar: The Last Airbender. I\u2019m really not an animated show kinda guy but oh boy was this show good for running through something I didn\u2019t have to take too seriously after a breakup. And it has a legitimately good arc as a show\n\n\u2022 Mythic Quest - surprisingly good show also on Apple TV. Ted Lasso is good too but does have a bit of romance and that was a bit hard\n\n\u2022 The Righteous Gemstones: hilarious show on HBO with almost no romance in it whatsoever- there is a tiny bit but it\u2019s mostly played for laughs\n\n\n\u2022 Money Heist - Spanish language show on Netflix. A bit of romance here and there but it\u2019s not the point and the show is really fun, really good. Great show for getting your mind off things.",

It\u2019s kinda like a Korean hunger games thing\u2026 craziness. No romance there (well one quick sex scene but they\u2019re not together or anything) \n\nI\u2019m honestly trying to rack my brain And think about a show with ZERO relationships / romance and I really am drawing a blank! \n\nIf she wants to feel better about herself she could watch Love After Lockup, but that\u2019s def all about relationships and specifically inmates dating a person when they come out of jail, who was supporting them while they were in jail. It\u2019s complete trash and I love it haha",

A relationship does develop later on between two main characters, but it\u2019s more of a side story instead of the focus.\n\nI also highly recommend [Wellington Paranormal](from the creators of What We Do in the Shadows). It\u2019s hilarious. Think an X-Files parody, but with plenty of dry humor and ridiculous situations. The trailers make it look a little scary, but it\u2019s definitely not.\n\nSeconding everyone who mentioned Chernobyl, and also The Walking Dead.",

It's just kind of in the background at the start of the episode. Otherwise, I think this is a perfect series for what you are looking for, OP.

That's how Lisa intends it. At least that's my guess.!< So your're right as the current seasons are, it won't be at all triggering. Which is also why I also recommend it as a watch. But I think the way it's playing out, imo, I'm like 99.9% sure it happens. Especially since it's the final season. How it happens who knows but if OP's sister watches the current seasons, she's going to want to watch Season 3, and then yeah that season might be triggering. Just something for OP to keep in mind.\n\nEdit: On second thought, I shouldn't have said \"at all\"... Idk, prom scene could be triggering. But if \"little to no romance\" is what you're looking for OP, that scene in that episode at least falls falls into \"a little\".",

They are: (and thanks for all suggestions!)    \n\n2/3 Dead to me, \nGood girls.    \n\n3/3 Marvelous  Mrs Maisel, \nKilling eve,  \nSharp objects, \nBridgerton.   \nHacks.   \n\n\n\nEdit 2: thanks again to all suggestions.

If you watch nothing else, watch this. A girl starts at her university course in biomedicine, but has a secret agenda. Every aspect of this is brilliant. The second season is equally as good, which is hard to do. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant)\n\n- I Am Not Okay With This (one season, girl trying to deal with her awkwardness and new crush on her bestfriend while also trying to deal with her newfound explosive superpowers. Brilliant)\n\n- Everything Sucks! (The 90s were cool, but everything still sucks. Very witty and cute story, one season. Brilliant)\n\n- iZombie (Girl wakes up in a bodybag and realises she's now a Zombie. Enough said. Real good)\n\n- Crashing (British, one season. Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jonathan Bailey. About a group of people who all are legal caretakers (like squatting but you pay rent) of a disused hospital. Brilliant) \n\n- Feel Good (British/Canadian. Mae Martin and Charlotte Richie and Lisa Kudrow. About a girl with previous addiction issues and her relationship with a 'straight' girl. I'm not doing it justice. Brilliant)\n\n- New Girl (Zooey Deschanel moves into a flat with 3 men. Shenanigans ensue. Heartwarming and cute and so so funny. Real good)\n\n- Baby (Based on a true story about an underground Italian underage prostitution setup. Really not as grim as it sounds, mostly focuses on the two main girls and their relationships as they go through this experience. Would HIGHLY recommend. Brilliant)\n\n- Masaba Masaba (Masaba Gupta and her mother in their own sit/dra/com. Mostly English with a little Hindi. Masaba is a famous designer trying to create a new collection while just finding out she's getting a divorce. Highly recommend. Brilliant)\n\n- The OA (Written by and starring Brit Marling. She's a blind girl who turns up in hospital after years being missing, suddenly able to see. We see what happened to her and why it's really important she finds a group of people to help her finish what she started. Real good)\n\n- Cntrl Z (someone starts revealing the secrets of everyone at the school and people's lives are ruined. Sofia is trying to find out who is behind it all. I don't do this justice, brilliant.)\n\n- Love And Anarchy (Sofie starts a new job updating the social media and marketing of a small book publishing firm. She gets accidentally involved in a lighthearted game of dares with one of her coworkers, getting her out of her rut. Again, I can't do this justice. Brilliant)\n\n- Sexify (with two months to go, a girl realises her technology entrepreneurship project is absolutely rubbish. And then she hits on gold: an app that tells women exactly how to get the most pleasure from sex. The only problem? She doesn't even know where to begin. Real good)\n\n- Cursed (the story of Nimue, the Lady of the Lake from the Arthurian legend, as she battles to free her people from the oppression of the church. Real good)",

Ostensibly, it's a show about the afterlife and one woman who *is* where she *isn't* supposed to be. It's a sitcom so the episodes are around a half hour, and it's already completed its run so she won't have to wait for more!\n\n It does have some mature subjects, but it's only light-hearted sitcom stuff for the most part, nothing you can't put on a local network at prime time.  Some talk about sex I think is probably the worst part about it.  Some vulgarity but that's spoiler-inducing so I won't go too deep in to it.",

Things do not go as planned.\n\n[Good Omens](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/) is simply one of my favs: A tale of the bungling of Armageddon features an angel, a demon, an eleven-year-old Antichrist, and a doom-saying witch.\n\nEdit: Love both Russian Doll and Queen\u2019s Gambit, but just a heads-up: Russian Doll isn\u2019t supposed to be a mini series but don\u2019t know what happened with the 2nd season, guess was postponed due to the pandemic.",

People say the one that came out in 2020 is garbage compared to the UK one, but I thought it was pretty interesting. \n\nIt\u2019s loosely about a comic book that predicts the end of the world; and weirdly it talks about conspiracies, pandemics, and mandated global vaccinations. \n\nThought it was odd to have been filmed prior to the craziness off 2020 and then released that year. It\u2019s dark humor for sure.",

Though it's pretty different in tone.\n\nThere was a show called Kingdom starting Frank Grillo that was really good but it's contract ran up. It was a unflinching look at a family of MMA fighters.

I totally get it being tough to keep track and made a lot more sense the second time I watched it. It does help having English subtitles on to get the names and locations straight because they aren\u2019t common names in the US. Once you get the gist of what is happening it\u2019s easier to keep track of things by the manes of characters and locations. I don\u2019t find the English audio overdub very good but left it on every season anyway along with the English subtitles that don\u2019t always match what is being said.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how the writers kept track of it all and just picture a room with a massive storyline taking up the whole wall with strings connecting things together kinda like the one seen in the show. If you stick with it you\u2019ll start to see what I mean. You\u2019ll probably see why I watched it twice with it being more satisfying the second time. You\u2019ll  also have a chance to pick up on little details that are hard to connect together on the first pass.\n\nAgain, I have no clue how the writers kept track of everything much less the viewer (especially on the first pass) trying to do so but it\u2019s well worth the investment if you like sci-fi stuff and can hang in there until the storyline starts to reveal itself.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly the most amazing sci-if show I\u2019ve ever seen if you like that kinda thing.",

He\u2019s a recent recovering alcoholic so our evenings are usually spent bonding over a good show, some ice and haribo gummies. We\u2019re both really struggling to come up with a new show to watch! I have pretty much every streaming service including showtime, HBO Max, etc so I\u2019m definitely not needing to stay within Netflix. When he was here last we watched The Expanse, The Boys and Queens Gambit.  If the show is somewhat popular, chances are we\u2019ve seen it! My husband and I recently finished Justified (discovered through this community) and highly enjoyed it! TIA!",

I know most people won\u2019t like it because it\u2019s in a different language and it gets pretty gory throughout the seasons, but if you don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s extremely hilarious. It\u2019s a reality show about detectives solving cases by going through obstacle courses, well planned challenges and such.

It's seriously one of the most seamless English language dubbings I have seen and even though I understand some German I watched most of it in English since the voice over actors are really good and it makes things easier to follow (it gets a bit complicated by season 3 to say the least, but provides answers rather than mystery boxes for their own sake).

A show I really enjoyed on Netflix that came over from another streaming service was Cobra Kai. I really enjoyed watching it because I hoped to learn some moves that would help me out in life. After one episode, I went to my car to get some milk and met a shadowy figure that beat me with a tire iron and threw a baseball at me. I\u2019ve really been trying to watch the show a lot more so I can defend myself better next time I meet the shadowy figure.

At least put on the first episode and give it a go while you still can! \n\nAlso, The One was like a longer Black Mirror episode.

        "text": "If you haven't watched breaking bad or game of thrones then do that. If you haven't watched Vikings after those, do that. \n\nIf you want a real emotional trip, watch Maniac on Netflix. Emma Stone and Jonah Hill are nuts in that show. It's about a clinical trial that makes people revisit their trauma and is just a complete mindfuck of a show. Highly recommended as one of my top favorite series to watch. \n\nThe queens gambit on netflix is a really good series about drugs and playing Chess, and is a short 8 episode series that was a great watch. \n\nRussian Doll on netflix is a goofy great 1 season series about a girl who dies over and over again and has to relive and fix her issues. Short watch and very entertaining. \n\nLongmire is a great series about a Colorado sherriff dealing with Indian reservation and local crime. \n\nHell on Wheels is a great story about building the USA transcontinental railroad with a lot of old west gun fights, Indians, and wild wild west shit. Also hookers. \n\nWestwood is an HBO series about a futuristic  \"theme park\" where there the \"residents\" of the town are all robotic people and everyone who pays to go can talk to, kill, fuck, and do whatever else they want to the residents. Also tits in that show. \n\nJason Mamoa plays a character named Declin Harp in Netflix series Frontier that's all about the 1800s after the Louisiana purchase of land in the US from the french. It's all about violence, booze running, and the fur trade in the early US.\n\nOne of my FAVORITE recent shows is The Deuce on HBO.  It centers around the up and coming pornography scene of the 70s in new york city. There's lots of violence, pimps and hookers, and gangster stuff. It's honestly one of my favorite shows that I will rewatch over again.",

Similar to *Breaking Bad* in that its consistently good till the end.  German with subtitles.\n\n*Better Call Saul* -- Probably on your list already if you watched Breaking Bad.\n\n*Call My Agent* -- Likeable characters and interesting situations.  French with subtitles.\n\n*Money Heist* -- A bank heist of sorts, played out over a full season.  Spanish with subtitles.\n\n*The Crown* -- Uncanny how they made often mundane situations into fascinating stories.  Every episode is a gem.\n\n*Ballers* -- I don't know why but I just like this show.  I like Dwayne Johnson, and enjoy the dialog and situations that come up.  Really good writing.\n\n*Umbrella Academy* -- Recommended by another commenter, and I agree.\n\nI'm also currently watching *Fargo*, *The Wire*, *The Leftovers*, and *The Americans*.  They're older, but I'd recommend any of them.\n\n(Sorry, not all of these are Netflix)",

Mr. Robot: s1 alone was well worth it. \n4. Deadwood: I think in terms of script dialogues, this shows the best.\n5. Six Feet Under: An old HBO classic. The public consensus says this has one of the best TV series endings.\n6. For All Mankind: surprisingly good writing after 2 eps in. binged this last week and i cant wait until the full s2 is out.\n7. The Undoing: If you enjoy Gone Girl\n8. Mad Men: this does take some life exp in order to appreciate\n9. the mandalorian: if you are a star wars original trilogy fan",

Fame, fortune, and love from millions can go to people's heads FAST, and they will be prone to doing evil stuff.

Bonus points if they're struggling with addiction or keeping some sort of major secret.\n\nSome examples of what I'm thinking of would be: Sherlock, Lucifer, Arrow, Queen's Gambit",

What really attracts a viewer is the attention to every single detail with which the film creators took a thoughtful approach to chess games. The movie makes your skin sense a hypertrophied tension through the screen. It enthralls and makes you really get involved in the game and worry about every move the main heroine takes. \n\nAfter watching the film, I think many people, even those far from chess, got interested in this game. And so did I!\n\nDriven by the miniseries, I am very much interested to discuss it with other fans. I would appreciate to know your impressions. Please share what you liked the most, and what might have been missing.\n\nAlso, please advise any similar TV series.\n\nAlways happy to hear from you, so write soon! The \ud83d\ude09",

Havent seen the US version but the UK one is great, please watch and then be angry with me because they didnt get to make another season I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS DAMN IT!)\n\nOUTER BANKS (kind of an underdog goonies story but I enjoyed)\n \nSUPERSTORE (super easy watching, great laughs, been binging all week)\n\nBLACK MIRROR (every. episode. Makes. Me. Fear. For. The. F.u.t.u.r.e... LOVE)\n\nSEX EDUCATION (I dont think you can not like this)\n\nYOU (everyone loves this, I agree)\n\nTHE OA (didnt get enough attention, sci-fi but twisted and so so good)\n \nI am not OK with this (great weekend watch or binge, super power but realistic story)\n\nSENSE 8 (LOVED this show, tackled everything from LGBT to full on action and sci-fi, the fan base managed to get a feature length ending when the budget ran out and was discontinued, please watch)\n\nRUSSIAN DOLL (loop concept, really enjoyed, song stuck in my head forever)\n\nMANIAC (crazy, fab, Emma Stone so cant go wrong)\n\nTHE GET DOWN (music, fabulous, Ezekiels voice is so nice)\n\nHAPPY!

Guys i cannot stress this enough, you are missing out on probably THE BEST SERIES in its genre. If you love thriller, and brainfuckingness, this show is for you.",

Is it good? Please tell me more!\n\nArrested Development is a classic comedy show, similar to the cheesy humor of The Good Place but never as deep.\n\nFreaks and Geeks is a classic tv show about teenagers in the 90's, just one season to bide your time between shows.\n\nGLOW is a show about female wrestlers in the 80's, but it's about their relationships together and getting support as a women's 'sport.'\n\nDead to Me is like Modern Family in a way? But about a woman who kills a man in a hit and run, then she befriends his family out of guilt. REALLY good, about interpersonal relationships and family.\n\nMy favorite show on Netflix is The OA, but it's unlike anything I've ever watched. It's about a blind woman who goes missing and returns with sight. Found family trope, a discussion of forgiveness and love and human nature, uplifting. The second season kind of spirals into uncharted territory, but s1 stands on its own!",

The character arcs are insane, every single thing has a meaning behind it.  The colors the characters wear, the shots, references, everything.\n\nAfter you watched that immediately watch El Camino.  I think the first time I watch it I was years removed from the BB universe.  This time I watched it right after the finale, and man, what a story.\n\nNow I'm on Better Call Saul.  Vince Gillian is the man, that's all I have to say.",

Characters are amazing, fun to follow, and many plot twists and turns. Plus it's not entirely a romantic show, lots of action, and historical aspects.",

I'd be surprised if you haven't. Everyone loved it!) \n* Haunting of Hill House (S1 is more scary, S2 is more of a gothic love story, both are great, and if you like Victoria Pedretti she's in season 2 of You)\n\nEnjoy!",

You definitely should check it out! \n\nWatched arrested development a while back, but didn\u2019t watch the seasons that were made later, after the pause, heard it isn\u2019t worth it!\n\nI\u2019m gonna check Freaks and Geeks out!\n\nGlow was Ok for me, not awesome, but ok. Finished it only because Alison Brie is in it!\n\nStarted dead to me, but didn\u2019t really got into it.\n\nThe OA, mind blowing! Watched the season 1 ending credits without moving, trying to wrap my brain around what I just watched! Didn\u2019t know there was a season 2. I just added it to my list!\n\nThanks a lot!",

That show has such beautiful messages about love and forgiveness and understanding and the value of human life. Makes me tear up to think about it!\n\nYou have impeccable taste, haha. You might also like Maniac the netflix show! It's in my top 5 and the writers are also very loving toward their flawed characters. I love shows that call you to love others.",

No scary shows please. I can do \u201cthrillers\u201d but I am not looking to have nightmares. \n\nThings I have watched and liked recently were Roswell NM, Bridgerton, cobra Kai, fire fly lane, Witcher, Lucifer. \n\nI watched the wink saga, pretty little things (that ballerina show), and queens gambit. I did not mind them. But they did not really hold my attention and I felt like I kind of had to power through the seasons. \n\nSo any recommendations?",

The world building in counterpart is awesome, and although they were hoping for more seasons the two seasons that were made tell a satisfying story. Great production, wonderful performances, good surprises and twists but not an over abundance of them, and overall just compelling and thoughtful storytelling. Highly recommend.",
