I get that she's not the establishment darling, and sexism and all, but she's the US champion and the first woman to do it, to boot. \n\nI'm no history buff so maybe things were just super different in the 60s, but it seems wild to me that she would be struggling to get bare subsistence sponsorship after rejecting the nutty Christian ladies. Surely she'd have a laundry list of standing offers, ready to throw a few thousand her way at the drop of a hat just to be associated with her accomplishments? ",

That\u2019s huge.\n\nUltra religious groups and that sort of organisations have plenty of money to give away. But if the government wasn\u2019t willing to sponsor her (ah, but sending a useless escort, that they could do), who would? It was a minor sport, the prizes were lower in the US than in the USSR.\u00a0\n\nThe federation didn\u2019t have deep pockets, and Beth wasn\u2019t the cupcake they expected her to be. Most of her friends weren\u2019t affluent either. And the only one who realistically could (Benny) was upset that she rejected his support earlier in the series and didn\u2019t trust her/held a grudge. Because I don\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t have the money. How understandable that is, or not, is another debate.\n\nGetting half the price of a house with such short notice isn\u2019t that easy, and even less so back then. You could argue that in 2024 she could\u2019ve used gofundme or other platforms, but back then, and with Beth\u2019s wonderfully uncompromising personality\u2026 it was not easy.\u00a0\n\nEdit: her moron of an escort implied the only reason why Beth would beat the president on a chess game was because \u201cTexas is a checkers state\u201d!!!! That\u2019s how seriously they took the game/her!!!!! And that\u2019s the government, who had actual political interest in the matter!",

I\u2019ve always interpreted that the accident scene happens right after that because young Beth is wearing the same dress in both scenes.

Since ATJ had buccal fat removal surgery, yeah, she has a \"slimmer\" face now \nBut Beth, her character, had a normal face. \n\nThis is why girls feel the need to change their looks and feel their face looks \"fat\" causing them to drastically change their appearance with surgery. To be honest I think it's a tragedy that many women, including Anya Taylor Joy have opted for this surgery that makes them look gaunt and strange. \n\nBeth was so beautiful, as was ATJ, with her gorgeous cheeks.",

Whenever they talk about chess, Alma always brings up either money, how nice the hotels are or personal reasons to go to tournaments.

He still pretty much confirms that he was attracted to Beth when saying she made him confused and it\u2019s so clear that he was attracted and confused when he met her AT 15/16 which is what makes it all weird and creepy. Like you said, he\u2019s older than her but it\u2019s really the fact that she was a minor.\n\nBenny is actually most likely is older than Townes because it\u2019s said that he was 8 in 1948 making him 23 when he first crossed paths with Beth; & it\u2019s mentioned how Townes plays for the university he goes to making him somewhere between 18-22 when he first meets her. But ya it\u2019s clear that when Benny crossed paths with her when she\u2019s 15/16, there\u2019s no attraction there from him unlike Townes.\n\nI was so surprised when Beth mentioned still \u201cbeing in love\u201d with Townes to Cleo when they barely even knew each other during the time they spent together in both Kentucky and Las Vegas. Heck she spent more time and knew Harry more than Townes (tho it was clear imho that she only slept with him and wanted him around because she didn\u2019t want to be alone). Also seeing her not feel bad at all when Benny made it clear to her that she hurt him was surprising with how much time they spent together along with the development feeling more thorough & the chemistry they had. Even if she sounded really happy to hear from Benny again, we didn\u2019t see her once feeling bad about it beforehand. It felt to me like they really downplaying his impact to not stray away from the story being a drama and not romance.\n\nSorry for the long message. It\u2019s been nearly a month since I watched but it\u2019s still on my mind lol",

So Alice being a math prodigy and having mental stability problems are inventions of the show. \n\nThat said, it makes sense for a show. Like George Lucas likes to say \"it rhymes\". As an audience, we like it, when themes reoccur. So yeah, I definitely think you're right, that they fleshed out the character of Alice with traits of Beth. Making us make the connection that Beth \"inherited\" them. \n\nBoth don't want to be \"controlled\" by others and think they themselves are in control of their lives, when they're clearly not. And when people who (used to?) love them and still care for them try to help, they refuse it. \n\nWhen Alice hit rock bottom, the only way out she saw was suicide. Beth was on a similar path down and could have ended the same way, but luckily, she had someone like Jolene come back into her life to set her straight and talk sense into her and made her accept help. Not the least bit by telling her how people (like Mr. Shaibel) were supporting her all her life. \n\nThe show lead us to assume that Alice did not have anyone in her life to get her to accept outside help. So there's a nice allegory for therapy in there, too. \n\nAnother big difference from book to show is (if I remember correctly) that in the book, Jolene didn't simply show up one day, but Beth actively reached out to her. Making the point that she herself was ready to change by then. While the show had a different focus there. I think both versions have right and reason to be how they are.",

It's obviously the framework in which the story happens, and heavily relies on the West's view of medicine and chess as intellectually/socially elite, but it's not what the actual story is about except that the framework is that it's elite. If the West saw Indian Tabla (drum) music as the epitome of human skill and achievement, this could equally well be the frame. (In India Tabla playing does have this high societal esteem.)",

I think we forget that Alma in the grand scheme of things was still quite young, and having married Mr Wheatley young, missed out on a huge chunk of her young life.

It's how Cleo was SO adamantT about seeing Beth! Beth repeatedly stated she couldn't come drink with Cleo-- knowing Beth had a huge tournament in the morning, who *wouldn't* stop at \"no\"?\n\nAnd c'mone... After pressuring Beth into drinking (eventually into oblivion), she brings up Townes, right? Cleo is the *only person* she ever said his name to.

Yes the Russians want to win these games (especially against American players, even in the real world), but they don't need to use a spy to sabotage her game. They, and particularly Borgov, are far superior players at the time of the Paris game that they can be confident enough they'll beat her. And if they can't beat her outright, they have adjournments and a team of GMs vs one girl.\n\nLet's suppose, though, that they did decide that they needed to use a spy to sabotage Beth. Okay, let's see how they went about it. They sent their spy two weeks before the tournament to go hang out with Benny's buddies. Not exactly a brilliant move on their part. This plan assumes that Beth will go to New York with Benny after the US Championship which, going by what they know of her character, is unlikely. It also assumes that Beth is attracted to women which is a weird assumption to make for people in the 60s, especially since I don't think we see much of an indicator of that in the show.\n\nWe know that Cleo hadn't sabotaged any of the guys and so the Russians have never viewed Benny or the others as much of a chess threat. So what is the point of keeping a spy around for years? Having spies in America was an extremely expensive and difficult endeavor for the Russians and to waste that on chess players they didn't think were very good seems foolish. All this is to say that her being in with the guys is probably just because they like having her around. She's a French model who openly sleeps with the three of them, of course they like having her around.\n\nWhy does she sabotage Beth if we want to call it sabotage? My guess is that she was jealous of her relationship with Benny. She clearly loves Benny on a level more than Benny loves her and to see him doing all this for some girl who he barely knew was probably hard for Cleo.\n\nThe Townes thing is interesting but also I think they probably knew she had a thing for him otherwise. Afterall, Harry says he thought Beth and Townes were together when Beth and Harry first reunite so it's probable that there was something we're unaware of there.",

I feel I gathered that specifically because of what you brought up; when they were talking about her in that elevator and Borgov seems to actually stick up for her, or at least show his respect. Then we see him with his children at the aquarium -- I think the show was trying to paint him in a \"good guy\" light. \n\nYou could be right, and we'll likely never know...

I think the show paints Borgov in a light showing us he has integrity. He even sticks up for Beth when his entourage is giving him intel on her (or at least shows respect for her).\n\nBorgov was certainly worried about Beth by the time Paris came. He was worried about her *before* Paris, which is exactly why his team was briefing him on her in Mexico in that elevator, and exactly why he showed respect for her when they did. He knew she was a great player and knew that if *anyone* was a threat to him, *she* was. Why do you think they were talking about her?",

I believe the show was trying to tell us that she was a spy.\n\nWhat you and I can agree on (I hope) is that Cleo sabotaged Beth. What we're disagreeing on is whether or not it was deliberate. I believe it was. Even Townes thought his quick visa was to distract Beth... No one knew about Townes except for Cleo. In Paris, Cleo randomly asks Beth if she's experienced unrequited love... Beth gives Towne's name. That's a strange thing to ask someone you've just met in the first place.\n\nCleo was aware Beth had drinking problems. If she was just a friend to Beth, who could be that awful to pressure her into staying up all night drinking before the biggest tournament of Beth's life? Who does that?\n\nMost importantly, why on Earth did Cleo's character exist if not to be a planted spy? Like, really think about it... If the writers wanted us to believe it was Beth's addiction/ lack of self control, they  would've gone a different route; perhaps they'd have Beth meet some random people at the Paris hotel and fuck up that way. But it was instead a character we were introduced to (who we then never see again). That's purposeful writing.\n\n*I can't respond adequately to the \"they stopped her from killing herself\" part because I am unsure of who you're referring to.",

It is only 7 episodes, but I was hoping for more of an exploration of her addiction, trauma, and difficulties with relationships. We didn't see her struggle much. She had some had times, but snapped out of them very quickly and with seemingly minimal effort. These topics were introduced, but never explored in depth. I was also interested in what would've happened if she started to lose interest in chess, or if she progressed as far as she could go. I apologize if this has been mentioned before, but I just finished the series (several years too late) and these were my thoughts.",

I really relate to her drive to prove herself in that environment. It\u2019s also very relatable that once you prove yourself they will typically then regard you with respect and as a peer in the environment, it just sucks to have to fight to the top to get it. I wish we could just exist in these environments and be given the benefit of assumption of competence at least to the average level that men assume of each other.

Still because she's a woman, but even more because she's an American.

I would argue her motive isn\u2019t even to be the best in the world, but to continue playing with players at a level where skill and respect for the game transcends those distractions. The fact some players have sexist attitudes seems to be viewed by her as another barrier that keeps her from being as immersed as she would like, and feels she must always win to remain in the chess world.  She finds that in the ending in the park. She simply doesn\u2019t have time for people who waste their energy judging the cover. I think she would view a player who would use their time and energy making judgements about the player rather than the game with contempt. \n\nAs a woman in STEM, it feels like this often. I love the field, I\u2019m learning alongside my colleagues and we all have knowledge gaps. I accept that, but sometimes I know my understanding of a certain concept is superior. In order to remain a part of the conversation and immersed in the field, I must constantly prove myself as competent. I have to take those extra hours to go above and beyond to make sure I 100% understand the material. Before we go into the practical setting where it\u2019s understood that we are learning, will have misunderstanding and are expected to make mistakes, I cannot. Otherwise, that one mistake is viewed as evidence of incompetence and anything I have to add to the conversation goes as unheard when we work as partners to solve a problems. It\u2019s so easy for a man who considers himself an expert in a field to dismiss what a female colleague is saying when he views her as incompetent. Nothing I could have to say could ever add to their knowledge, so why bother taking the time to comprehend my words? I have wasted hours of my time trying to get a male colleague to understand how to solve a problem because he simply will not believe that I have a suggestion that could help. Sometimes they end up confusing themselves so much they eventually find the answer from another source and then convince themselves that wasn\u2019t explicitly what I had said. To be fair, occasionally they will say, oh, now I understand what you were saying and we can chalk it up to a communication issue where I just wasn\u2019t explaining myself clearly enough. Lol. After a few of those instances, I have noticed my words will carry a different weight with these same colleagues and they will begin to listen to me.",

Its not that she's isn't bothered by it or doesn't care. It's just she has her goal and she's just doing what she needs too to achieve it and be comfortable. \n\nWhile this might sound odd I think anyas casting plays into your second point as well. Her being ridiculously beautiful plays a large part as to why she's treated as curious and interesting by many of the men early on. Almost like a unicorn instead of a person. We see this even in the final match with borgov. Same goes for her prodigy level talent. \n\nA normal looking beth who's pretty good but not a grandmaster will get ignored entirely or catch a much worse case of prejudice. Obviously I don't think it is right or a pleasant topic to broach but I know many many men and what some say about women when women aren't around. I think this plays a part in making her treatment believable at the time but also doesn't downplay that beth earned her place and isn't just coasting. \n\nI find it interesting that cleo (enigmatic as she is) seems to understand this in her last scenes. She tries to remind beth that most women haven't gotten the pass she has and to be aware of it. Do you have thoughts on that dialogue?",

She then beats Vietnamese champ, and then flies to US where she takes on Sugar Ray Leonard AND ABSOUTELY CRUSHES HIM!!! Then fights Marvin Hagler and takes World champ belt. Why? Because she is a woman with autism and hyperfocus on drugs!",

How is it possible that, among the vast number of women involved in chess during that era, none managed to ascend to a level where they could consistently outplay any of the top 20 male Grandmasters of the time?\n\nOr perhaps you've considered that there appears to be minimal development in her gameplay? From employing the same Sicilian dragon opening that the janitor introduced to her in the basement, to ultimately being defeated by the reigning US Champion in episode 3, only to repeat the same strategy against Soviet Masters who, as Benny put it, \"devoured him for breakfast\"? Isn't it absurd that nobody seemed to grasp how to counter a Levenfish dragon, funneling her into a vulnerable line where she could, at best, hope for a draw against the array of Soviet Grandmasters she effortlessly conquered?\n\nThe absurdity peaks when an elderly Soviet Grandmaster claims to have played the best game of his life, while Beth employs that exact same textbook Sicilian variation! It's utterly hilarious and cringe-inducing. Everyone remains oblivious to the unfolding pattern, oblivious to their upcoming opponents, failing even to prepare for probable matchups despite their status as world-renowned Soviet Grandmasters. And then, they react as if witnessing a miracle when Beth executes her strategy, which remains consistent in 70-90% of the games we witness (the remaining 30% being even more ludicrous, with players making illegal moves and horses inexplicably morphing into horse-bishop hybrids!).\n\nThis reminds me of Hunger games, where the red-head girl hero climbs up the tree and 4 idiots who according to the script \"where trained to kill others all their life\" decide to sleep underneath the tree instead of  climbing it or idk throwing rocks at her for her to get down. Not only that they are oblivious to a giant wasp nest hanging on the tree branch that she then cuts down onto their heads while they sleep (lol)",

The movieself-centered is simply not about chess, it's about Beth and does a very poor job there as well imo...\n\nI haven't read the novel, maybe the novel is better just like Harry Potter, can't judge there. However, in the series her character is extremely hollow, there is no proper exploration of chess progression as I said before, her character is basically just a stone-cold wonder woman assassin of chess (who looks down on other women chess players as instantly inferior the way series portrays it as she doesn't even consider playing against other woman GMs for whatever reason). She is just a bitch to everyone, and always gets what she wants by being a bitch, all her guy friends are just simps who she fucks in the end lol (one even asks her permission to remain in the bed after intercourse). \n\nThere is no exploration of internal struggle within her at all, how death of her mother affected her, characters drop in and out randomly throughout the series, get developed a bit and then abandoned (WTF HAPPENED TO JANITOR Shaibel, she just alienated him and didn't even return him his % on the winnings, what a self-centred bitch)... Everyone in the movie is just a simp who is like: [https://youtu.be/zsFoeENih8s](https://youtu.be/zsFoeENih8s) she da best eva! In chess tournaments, such emotional displays are very very very rare, except perhaps for Fischer's notorious complaints about everything (but that's a different tale altogether). Overall, I would rate \"Pawn Sacrifice\" a 7.5 (some inaccuracies as well, and completely overlooks Fischers sexist stance towards woman stemming from his relationship with his mother) , and \"The Queen's Gambit\" a 4 out of 10 on Chess movie scale.",

It was like a painful sparkle right in my chest. \nI had to go back and watch over and over again how that old Russian man was placing his pieces. At some point I\u2019ve started crying and couldn\u2019t understand why.\n\nAnd do you know what it was? You not gonna believe it. It was this damn green fabric on the inside. Just a fabric.\n\nLike almost all Russian kids I\u2019ve spent all summer with my grandparents. Sunny poor rural village, old house (made all by grandfather himself!) with a garden.\nI was never a social kid and didn\u2019t want to spend time outside, with other kids. I was always at home, spending time with my grandparents and playing with very very old wooden and metal toys.\nAnd my grandfather had this classic, very soviet tbh, chess set. It was a gift from his brother, good and high quality one.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t play chess. It\u2019s not that poetic, I wish it was. I actually suck at chess, I\u2019m the worst player ever.\n\nBut I was a kid who loved that set. I would put the pieces in and out, put them on the board in any position I like, even imaging that pieces are magicians or smth. Idk, I was a weird kid.\n\nAnd this fabric on the inside. This damn green fabric. I still can fell it, so soft yet so harsh, spiky even. And I loooved the sound of putting pawns in the box. Very gentle clunking sound.\n\nMy grandfather died many years ago. My grandma had to move to another place and that set got lost. I of course forgot about it \u2013 last time I\u2019ve seen it was at least 15 years ago and it was just a fun toy to play with when I was a very little girl.\n\nYet I still cried. I cried over a few seconds scene with an unnamed old man setting his chess pieces.\n\nI sobbed over a simple green fabric inside a chess box.\n",

He showed up with fixed teeth, a flashy car, and told her he'd been waiting for her to come back to town. He had a whole fantasy in his head where she'd realize how cool and handsome he was and be swept off her feet. He was swooping in to be her knight and shining armor by training her. What he came to realize was that she wasn't into him at all despite being willing to sleep with him. She was waay out of his league with chess and so completely obsessed that she couldn't really talk about anything else. Chess would always be at the core of their relationship. She wouldn't suddenly see him as a man worth knowing beyond the game and she herself didn't really have anything else to offer. So he gives up the posturing, gets a boring car, a boring job that he enjoys, and takes classes to pursue a new future focused on himself and not a dream he had of being Beth Harmon's man. Despite it all he remains a good friend and seems to move on without too much resentment. Beth is who she is and that's not who he thought. He accepts this.",

When I dug further, I thought this might be something my wife would enjoy. I know she digs costumes of this period and cinematography like that. Turns out, we both thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nIt had pretty good pacing overall, solid dialog and good acting, the film score was fitting and obviously the visuals were stunning. There were only a few slightly cringy acting moments that I can recall. Honestly, for Netflix, I was expecting more of those. I thought the final episode did a good job of tying everything together and adding some unexpected twists. I thought Benny might show up in Moscow somehow, so I got that wrong. And even though all the guys back home together at Benny's place was a little unrealistic and cheesy, it didn't really bother me in the moment.\n\nThe end feels complete and the 7 episodes was just about right, but when you have something good like that, it's only natural to want more. It's definitely left open for a possible season 2, but as I've seen others say, it's better to leave it where it is and not risk tarnishing what was a great series. ",

The part where they say \u201ccapablanca would have beat Borgov~not every game~every game that counted\u201d in the show Harry is the one saying not every game but in the book Harry is the one saying capablanca would win every game. In the show it paints the picture that Beth shouldn\u2019t play on intuition alone. In the book the exact same dialogue instead paints the picture that Beth SHOULD play on intuition HOWEVER she is not good enough to compare herself to capablanca yet.

This is a good library of openings and book moves: [https://www.chess.com/openings](https://www.chess.com/openings)\n\nGreat: Great moves are ones that alter the course of the game in your favor, and are sometimes harder to find than good moves.\n\nGood: Good moves are decent moves, but not really the best you could have made in that position.\n\nInaccuracies: Inaccuracies are weak moves, like ones that leave you vulnerable to future attacks.\n\nMistakes: Mistakes give you a worse position immediately, giving the other player the advantage.\n\nBlunders: Blunders are pretty much the worst moves you can make, like sacrificing a valuable piece without reason or leads to an inevitable checkmate.\n\nMissed win: Missed wins are basically what they sound like; you had an opportunity to checkmate/play moves that lead to your eventual checkmate, and you didn't play them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you like chess, try looking at [chess.com](https://chess.com)!

                "comment_text": "If you wanted to write a paper, I would rank the episodes in importance this way- \n1. Episode One\n2. Episodes six and seven tie \n3. Episode four and five tie \n4. Episode two and three tie\n\nHere\u2019s why- \n1. Episode one sets up the basis for addiction, would be great for the first main point of your paper- the seeds of addiction can be sown young. Beth\u2019s trauma from her mothers death, her ignorance about the true addictive nature of the pills (and what other commenter said about laws) informs the seeds of addiction; most people who are addicts don\u2019t jump down the rabbit hole fast of substance abuse, but have a foot in the door to future addiction which can be a slippery slope.\n\n2. Episodes 6 and 7 are the second most important ones to watch because they set up a good third point for your paper, as well as a possible paper conclusion. If you only use episode 1 for your paper, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough for a full paper there. With episode 6 and 7, you can prove how addiction in adolescence wreaks havoc into adult life if not properly handled, and how addiction rears its head when life gets incredibly stressful. First half of episode 6 is where Beth is sober, it\u2019s useful for a conclusion (explained down below), but in the second half she spirals after her night out in Paris. Good examples for a paper would be beltik checking up on her and how addiction pushes away those who love you and that nobody can make an addict get help but themselves, and meeting Annette her first opponent (who looks up to Beth as a prodigy, but meanwhile Beth knows the truth about how sad her addictive state is). \n\nYou could conclude your essay with a hopeful note, the first half of episode 6 and the second half of 7 are useful for this! Benny and Jolene, helping her with sobriety, showing her that you can succeed without substances and the importance of a social support network that understands and empathizes with what an addict is going through. \n\n3. Episodes 4 and 5 could be the second big point of your paper. 4 is useful for 2 things, first is pointing out how substance use can seem casual and fun (the party with the stoners from russian class) and second, substance use can be familial as Beth\u2019s adoptive mom passes away from addiction and passes on the trauma to her, and Beth orders a Gibson drink in her mothers honor. 5 is important since that\u2019s where she spirals the most after her mothers death. Important examples include first, the instance where beltik says he\u2019s worried for her usage and compares her to \u201cthe pride and sorrow of chess\u201d, who died early and went mad, and second, when she runs into Margaret her bully from high school (who\u2019s now an alcoholic too) to show addiction is much more rampant in society and can be hidden. \n \n4. If you need more examples to bulk up your paper of how addiction starts young and reinforces itself, use these episodes, but they\u2019re not crucial to your main argument. Episode 2, only drug point is Beth steals her moms tranquilizers, and 3 Beth steals gin from the social club girls- showing how those addicted will lie to their loved ones and acquaintances to further their substance abuse, and how the entryway to addiction can start from everyday common scenarios that aren\u2019t dangerous or destructive. \n\nSorry if I wrote too much or seemed like I wanted to dictate your paper- I just used to really love writing essays on this stuff, so feel free to use my essay structure (episode 1 for your first point, episodes 4 and 5 for your second, and 6 and 7 for your third! Episodes 2 and 3, you only really need to cite those two small instances and don\u2019t need to rewatch for your paper) or message me for anything else!",

Started playing chess recently so I thought I'd pick up this show again, and christ was the ending a gut punch\n\n\\- Mr Shaibel was the best. The ending scene with the board was probably the scene that made us all cry buckets. Give your older loved ones a call yall. Special shoutout to Alma, even though she was in it for Beth's prize money I couldn't blame her for having bills to pay. I loved the scene after their fight showing them holding hands. It's just sad they had to take her last living parent away. \n\n\\- The boys: I couldn't tell if I was supposed to take Benny seriously with the cowboy hat and the leather jacket and knife and worst of all the MOUSTACHE. It didn't help that Thomas looks 13 going on 30 but my guy, what the hell. Harry was sweet and I felt bad that Beth just used to keep him around cus she was so lonely, but boy took it well and showed up for her at the end. \n\n\\- I wished they had shown more shots of the boards and the games being played. The matches are mostly montage and only the final game had more coverage of the moves and the camera showing us the positions. It wouldn't been fun if we'd seen a real match like how we see things online games nowadays. \n\nWhat fantastic work by the team, I hope everyone keeps playing chess :)",

Spent an hour searching for it with no success. Only found when her ghost in a window reflection says that. But I\u2019m sure there was a car scene somewhere. \n\nIf you\u2019ve watched it recently, maybe you can help me find it?",

She was obviously very infatuated with him, which we knew from context clues and her saying so to Chloe. \n\nWe learn in the last episode that all he really wanted was a friend. He wanted a friend from the 15ish year old girl he met at a chess tournament? And then several years later lures her to his hotel room to be a friend? And then several years later spontaneously goes on a trip to Russia to be her friend? \n\nThe math ain\u2019t mathing. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, it feels like a PC move to make him gay. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dangle this potential romance for you romance lovers for the entirety of the series, but just kidding!\u201d",

None of the romances go anywhere concrete, which makes them feel a bit meaningless. Not that all of them needed to go somewhere, but at least one of them would have been nice. \n\nI think it would have made more sense if they kept Benny as the main romance like the novel.

And when she said Townes I personally interpreted it as like a \u201cone that got away\u201d type thing that\u2019s implied there will be more. But yeah they definitely could\u2019ve done without that bit, felt unnecessary but also that\u2019s how women are treated in media so maybe it\u2019s realistic",

She feels attraction and enjoys sex, but holds herself aloof from real connection and vulnerability, seeing it as weakness. \n\nIt felt like everything got rolled in the final episode when she realizes William Shaibel and Jolene not only followed her career, but each gave her money to enter important competitions. Neither was well off, and like the widow's mite, they gave what little they had because they cared about her. As Jolene said, they're family. \n\nThen, when Townes gathers a 'team' for her (like the Russians play as a team) it's again because people care; people who show up for her in difficult times. That sort of love - the kind that sticks around even when she pushes them away - is what helps her see her own value, not just as a chess master, but as a person worthy of being loved.\n\nThe 'romance' is her loving herself, finally. Not in an ego driven way, but in a way that allows her to connect to other people, even the old man in the park who invites her to play right before the credits roll. Beth can walk in the world without her armor.",

Beth never really processes things completely, she plays them out on the board, so when Beth is hurt or lost or confused and the glass starts to crack, she\u2019d rather feel high and numb than having to face the Beth shaped void in the mirror that is filled with feelings, thoughts and needs she mutes out with chess and pills.",

Im conflicted because she was like really tweakin and hungover but at the same time I feel like she wasnt ready anyways and losing was something that needed to happen for her improvement and character development for her to beat him in russia. Especially since after she lost she reconnected with jolene and went to mr shaibels funeral and saw that he was collecting the pictures of her I really think that gave her the push she needed. But if you really think about it all the training she did with benny and studying borgovs games I feel like if she wasnt hungover that day she couldve beat him but it wouldnt have been near as satisfactory because she was in a bad place and her story wasnt over yet.

First, there's the mental game, which Beth learns when she loses to Benny the first time in Las Vegas. But there's also the question of \"character\". You don't get character by playing the game, you get it by living real life.   \n\nIn Paris, Beth wasn't ready to win. She hadn't developed character yet, and getting drunk is one way she shows she doesn't have \"it\". \n\nI think you're on the right track. She needs to reconnect with her past, face being an orphan, give Mr Shaibel credit for opening the door, face her addictions. In Russia, her maturity level is a mile ahead of where she was in Paris.\n\nFor me, your question goes to the heart of the whole series!",

I\u2019ve always heard that serious chess players frown on speed chess because it somehow cheapens the game. However, being able to think out moves quickly helps with envisioning the board and moves/counter moves - much like she did on the ceiling when she was high. \n\nAt Benny\u2019s, she wasn\u2019t popping pills or drinking. He said no drugs or booze. She learned speed chess clean as a whistle and the results made her a much stronger chess player. \n\nUnfortunately, in Paris, she was hungover from getting tanked. It clouded her judgement and hampered what she learned from Benny.  \n\nIt\u2019s also the first time she encountered failure on her own because Alma was there the first time. Now she had no one. She was alone by choice because she returned to Ohio not New York to be with Benny.",

In the actual position, she played h5 (which is the mistake Benny was referring to), and it is a slight inaccuracy.\n\nThe idea of c4 is that it disconnects the knight on b3 from the defending queen on g8, forcing it to retreat to avoid being captured by the queen. The idea isn't simply to kick the knight, there's a few different ideas after the knight is kicked away, but it is a winning move that leads to a very strong queenside attack.\n\nThe other problem is that if white doesn't play c4, black can actually just capture on c3 and create counterplay, which would've resulted in a tough position, but in the show, Beltik instead plays c5, which allows Beth to retain her advantage. It's a complex position, but you can probably find the full game somewhere and analyse it yourself, it's quite interesting\n\nAlso, just to clarify, it's not winning for black even if Beltik finds the best moves, it just makes the situation more complicated. White still has an edge even if Beltik found the right move, which he didn't.",

Also you didn't talk about sex therefore it is not a normal thought for a 13-15 year old to stick something into your vagina. \nShe throws them away and just lays toilet paper inside her underwear because it is easier to manage.\nAlso she is in a stressful situation which is not the best time for learning how to use a tampon. \nAnd fun fact the first few periods are often lighter than periods later on, that's why the toilet paper is enough to soak a bit of blood. With heavier periods you need pads or tampons (or other gadgets) because you loose way more blood.",

I\u2019ve also been learning about kibbe types, seems that I like to put Beth in Gamine lines (according to interviews, fashion wise she\u2019s based off of Audrey Hepburn, so its no surprise that I kept putting her in outfits that Audrey would wear)\n\nAnya Taylor Joy, Beth\u2019s actress is unverified but r/kibbe seems to type her as Dramatic type, if she is it would explain why the gamine clothing looks small on her whenever I draw her.",

As she matured mentally, her clothes became more and more sophisticated, climaxing at the end dressed like the White Queen. She was the Queen on the chessboard so it only makes sense that she emulate her board persona in her real life. In a metaphorical way, it showed her dreamscape and reality finally coming together as one.\n\nAlso I noticed she her selections were very Chanel-esque, which is telling as she ends the series alone much like Coco Chanel. Both women were stoically independent and saw men as trinkets not the main events in their lives. \n\nClean lines. Subtle embellishments. All Chanel. That\u2019s probably why I love her clothes so much. (Not to mention the time period which was deliciously rich in fashion history. )",

Manners and demeanor is a very important part of that, you show the opponent respect in both your play and sportsmanship. \n\nIn the play this means that once the game is past the point of salvation you resign, you don't keep playing and pray for miracles as that's usually a waste of the opponents time and seen as insulting. When you are down a queen with nothing to show for it, expecting the opponent to screw the game up is basically spitting in their face if they're on a somewhat equal level of strength to you - especially in classical time formats.\n\nOnce you see the forced mate sequence or when your position is hopeless it's when you resign. There are exceptions to this, for example when your opponent played a beautiful attack - sometimes you allow your opponent to execute their brilliancy all the way to the end, but that's generally in games where you got absolutely crushed and the sentiment is sort of understood. \n\nYou shake hands before and after the game, come properly dressed and don't disturb the opponent for the duration of the game. It's also very common for clashing opponents to discuss the game with eachother right after playing it, despite the loser probably just wanting to leave the board even at the highest level. \n\nOnline is a very different story, but chess over the board holds its sportsmanship to a very high degree and everyone takes it very seriously because nobody's going to discriminate the moves you play anyway, xenophobia doesn't change the board and everyone knows that. It's also a brutal game to learn, Beth is a prodigy that took to it very quickly but for us non-geniuses you'd be surprised how frustrated some wood and 64 squares can make you so people generally try to respect the work you put in to keep playing since it's one of the few games where you have to shoulder every loss without any excuses from the very start until your last game",

Understand that I'm not saying people are wrong today. Just that some of the nuance has washed out. Yes, Jolene's actions were fucked up. Yes, it was traumatic for Beth. But Jolene is not a villain. She's a victim, too, and I think Tevis was trying to show us how messed up their situation was. These kids were locked up together, deprived of love and healthy touch. Jolene was in full adolescence, and just didn't know what else to do. She didn't bear any malice toward Beth. She didn't have a predatory nature, and she didn't push it after that.\n\nThings like this happen sometimes, when kids are confused, lonely, and uneducated.

Forget the dialogue for a moment. \n\nOne of the funniest non-verbal moments (to me at least) was at the college kid's house, right after Beth's first experience with a boy. It didn't go so well and the guy got off and she just patted him on the shoulders as if to say, \"You gave it your best shot, kiddo.\" LOL\n\nAnother one was Beth's eye roll in the back of the Mexican's car when her mom was being hit on by her pen pal. Beth saw right through it but she couldn't say anything because her mom was having too much fun getting male attention and Beth must have felt she needed it.\n\nThere are many such moments.

And even in the series, the idea that Cleo is working for the Soviets is pure fan speculation. It's plausible, but without evidence.\n\nThe miniseries was apparently quite popular in Russia. One reason is that the Soviets are not shown as villains. In fact, there's a sweet nostalgia for the Soviet Union's former greatness.\n\nBeth is portrayed as a gladiator in the grand coliseum of Soviet chess. Contrast that to the US chess championship, played in a midwestern college lecture hall, with Benny gesturing towards the overweight spectator asleep in his chair. Borgov's embrace of Beth at the end of the match demonstrates that the Soviets are not villains at all, but lovers of the cerebral purity of the game and respectful of Beth's talent.\n\nThat's why I'm skeptical of the Cleo-as-Soviet-agent theory. There may be bad agents among the Soviets, but that's not the overarching theme of the series.",

She looks in the mirror and hates how she looks.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna Taylor Joy was a model before she was an actress. The second coming of Andie McDowell, who followed the same modeling-to-acting path.\n\nI''m not complaining. Watching Beth probably plays a bigger part in my enjoyment of the series than I'm comfortable admitting. But it's not faithful to the book.",

I probably don't have the words exactly right, but this is the gist of it:\n\nAfter Beth wins the Kentucky state championship, a flabbergasted Alma says \"I had no idea people made money playing chess.\"\n\nBeth says, \"Oh, winners get money at all the tournaments.\"\n\nAlma says, pointedly, \"How much money?\"\n\n\"I don't know...thousands?\" says Beth.\n\nAlma's just been abandoned by her husband and doesn't know how she'll make ends meet. She is drowning and has just found a life raft. You can see the dollar signs in her eyes.\n\nThat was not in the book. An astute reader would have found it obvious, but the dialogue was missing. The screenwriters made it explicit. It's a small thing, but an improvement, I think.\n\nIn the match in Russia, there was some disembodied, omniscient commentary by Walter Tevis that the screenwriters copied word for word and put in the mouth of the British announcer, who presumably was broadcasting to the chess equivalent of sports fans. Completely unoriginal in terms of new material, but a clever way of including existing material into a screen adaptation.\n\nI could go on for hours but I'll stop, as I've said a lot of this before on this subreddit.",

I believe the part you\u2019re referencing is the following:\n\nBeth hesitated a moment. \u201cWas there ever anything between you two?\u201d She remembered those extra green pills. \nJolene laughed. \u201cWishful thinking.\u201d\n\nThe \u201canything\u201d here is, I think, a little ambiguous \u2014 it could refer to romantic connection, independent of sexual. That said, on its own, I think your interpretation is more likely. But there\u2019s also the following, from early on when Beth and Jolene are at the orphanage:\n\nBeth looked at her incredulously. The staff didn\u2019t confidences with orphans. \u201cFergussen\u2026?\u201d\nJolene leaned over and spoke seriously. \u201cHe and I been friendly from time to time. Don\u2019t want you talking about it, hear?\u201d (p. 25)\n\nWhat \u201cfriendly\u201d here is I think also ambiguous. It could mean just flirting. It could mean something more sexual. It could mean nothing at all, with Jolene just seeing things that aren\u2019t there. But at the least, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s suggestive of something sexual. And since the part OP was asking about seems to be during the orphanage, I thought it\u2019d be reasonable to say they\u2019re picking up on something sexual that\u2019s being implied. \n\nAll of this is, of course, interpretation and we might just be interpreting things differently!",

And if you like it, as I'm sure you will, try a few of Walter Tevis's other novels.\n\nThe novel is quite close to the miniseries, even down to a lot of the dialogue. All the characters in the miniseries are also characters in the book, even if some plot points are changed. The descriptions of the games at the climax in Russia are transposed in the miniseries into the words of the announcer. All in all, the novel is extremely satisfying, especially in regard to the Beth-Borgov relationship. That man is terrifying.\n\nThe Hustler and The Color of Money both follow a similar plot progression. If you liked Queens Gambit, you'll probably like those too.\n\nHis science fiction is great also. The Man Who Fell to Earth, of course. But it is a lesser known dystopian, post-apocalyptic novel, Mockingbird, that I think is his best.\n\nI'm now reading a book of his science fiction short stories, Far from Home. It's very unusual and doesn't fit into normal sci-fi tropes. The narrator's parents come back from the dead to visit and show what they were like as young people. Walter Tevis obviously lived in New York and had a lot of psychotherapy.\n\nBut start with Queens Gambit if you haven't read it. It will satisfy your Beth Harmon jones.",

I think it speaks well of the screenwriters. \n\nAfter Beth has  won the tournament and presents her $100 check to her mother, her mother says \" I had no idea that people could make money playing chess.\"\n\nBeth says, \"There are lots of tournaments where the winners get prize money.\"\n\nHer mother says, \"How much money?\"\n\nBeth says, \"I don't know. Thousands?\"\n\nYou can just feel the reaction of her mother, abandoned by her husband and wondering how she will make ends meet. And then the next scene has her mother with the copy of Chess Review planning out the next tournament in Cincinnati.\n\nThis sequence was not in the book. But it was in the miniseries. I like how they made an explicit connection between Beth's triumph and her mother's response, grasping at a lifeline to a new possibility of supporting herself. In the book, the connection was implied; in the miniseries, it was explicit. Happy that the screenwriters made it explicit.",

I may be misremembering these, since it's been a while since I've watched the miniseries, so please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1. Jolene bailed out Beth when she lacked funds to go to Russia in the miniseries, but not in the book.\n\n2. The San Francisco tournament prior to going to Russia, after Jolene had helped Beth rehabilitate herself, occurred in the book but not the miniseries. Cut for length, I imagine.\n\n3. In the book, Beth forfeited a game at the Kentucky state championships when she was in danger of losing to an insignificant local player. Don't think this happened in the miniseries. I think she just dropped out.\n\n4. The reunion with Annette Packer at the Kentucky state championships occurred in the miniseries but not the book. Same with the conversation/confrontation with Harry Beltik at the same event.\n\n5. In the miniseries, Townes was clearly gay. In the book, he was not. (Or if he was, there was no indication.)\n\n6. How did Beth find Jolene, her savior? In the book, she called Helen Deardoff at Methuen. In the miniseries, I think Jolene just magically showed up.\n\n7. In the miniseries, when Benny Watts called Beth in Russia, one of the members on the Beth team was Harry Beltik. Not in the book. (Appropriately, in my view. I guess they thought they needed some kind of reconciliation between Harry and Beth.)\n\n8. Townes showed up at the Russian tournament in the miniseries, but not in the book.\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment, and as I said, I may have some of these wrong, so please correct me if that's the case. And if you can add to this list, please do.\n\nI do agree with you that the scriptwriters had an easy job. They simply copied what Tevis wrote for the most part. But a lot of the appeal of the series was in the casting and costuming and sets, so I wouldn't belittle the producers. It was a magnificent production, as evidenced by this Reddit forum devoted to it..",

So....\n\nI asked Mr. Pandolfini for his opinion on a line I'd found in \"Modern Chess Openings\", which Beth Harmon is seen reading in one scene (though an earlier edition), which I believed was flawed.  His initial reaction seemed to be one of reluctance, perhaps he didn't like getting thrust into having to disagree with my conclusions.  Luckily for both of us I guess, he actually had a look and told me I was right.\n\nI will give some chess details below for anybody that might be interested.  The opening is the Vienna, and after  1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. fxe5 Nxe4 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Qe2 Ng5 7. Qb5 c6 8. Qxb7 Nxf3 9. gxf3 Bxf3 Modern Chess Opening didn't provide an evaluation, instead I suppose that the implicit conclusion was that Black was both threating White's king's rook, and checkmate.  See the diagram below.  My own conclusion was that White can address *both* Black's threats with Rg1 sliding his rook one square to the left\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwf7vhoxpmua1.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1db60ba6a850b69308609ab799ead327b30fbf4",

I did post as a top level thread with a different account about a year ago, but I don't mind re-telling in a comment.\n\nIt was at a tourney in NYC in 1982 where very strong players including grandmasters were playing against one another, but also set up so that amateurs could play amateurs.  I was 19 and showed up to the board with a paperback, I remember which one to this day, Lermontov's \"A Hero of Our Time\".  I had no idea who Walter Tevis was.\n\nIn any case after the game we found a quiet place for a \"post-mortem analysis\", something they left out of the TQG mini-series (not criticizing, in general I thought they did the chess more than reasonably well).  In reviewing the game we came to the conclusion that what helped me win was that stayed one step ahead for the final 10 moves or so, the so-called *initiative*.\n\nBefore parting ways he urged me to keep reading, which makes sense in retrospect, and I took it to heart.  A year later and a thousand miles away I read a book review in a newspaper, a review of \"The Queen's Gambit\", which of course I then bought and read.  Sadly he died the year after that.",

Since you were playing in tournanments at the time perhaps you can address the rules they said they were using. \n\nOn day 1 there were 4 matches per player and each lasted 90 minutes per player, max.  IIRC the time on day 2 was 120 minutes per player. Anyway when your time ran out you lost, I don't think that's right unless there's something else they left out. \n\nPlayers who could move faster would have a huge  adavantage and from what I've  read when a game was called for time it was given to a judge to evaluate who was in the stronger position and that was your winner.\n\nOne other thing were either of you rated at that time ?

She needed an adult to travel.\n\nAs for the 1964 tournament there were several things that would have been problematical. 1) possibly she would not have been rated yet. That required submitting 30 *qualifying* games and a 3 or 4 month wait. At best that would be May or June of 1964. FWIW IIRC she metioned her initial rating was 1900. 2) Money. She was paying for travel from her winnings. Vegas ain't cheap and in that big a tournament she might not have covered costs. That would be my guess.",

By the time she hit Vegas in 1966 she would have been a master but there are so few players at the next level that going higher would have been very hard.

The twins were condescending to her at first, Beltik didn't take her seriously at all until she handed him his ass. There's definitely undertones of misogyny for them because there would be for most men in this time period, but I feel like most times in a show when misogyny is portrayed they make the characters into complete one dimensional assholes instead of complex characters.",

I meant the males that played a big role in the show- Beltik, Benny, and Townes. I provided examples for how each were irrelevant or assholes in the book, and the other poster agreed with one of them. \n\nFor the record, asking me a question is cool, but downvoting all of my comments comes off as hostile, frankly rude, and not super conducive to having a respectful discussion about a fictional story.",

I don't understand all the criticism he is getting. He had good intentions, was loyal to Beth and cared so much for her well-being.\n\nTownes gave me the creeps for reasons I can't explain, and I found Benny unattractive and annoying. If Beltik were chasing me he'd easily won me over. I can't be the only one.",

A lot of characters make the mistake of underestimating her at first, but they all come around in the end. \n\nThere's a lot of foreboding scenes and shots where you think someone is going to do something awful to her, but in the end, they don't. And most people even go out of their way to help her. \n\nBeth's demons are all internal. \n\nBeltik was  special because he actually identified Beth's problem and had a real understanding of it, and he knew what the solution needed to be. He had real wisdom, and he cared. He's the kind of friend we all need.\n\nI think Townes character comes off older than he actually is supposed to be. He's on a university team when they play the first time, so ... what? Maybe 4 years older? Too old for her in that first Kentucky tournament. But later, probably not inappropriate. But I do think the character comes off as older and polished and more mature, and that does feel creepy.",

Show-Townes is more of an amalgamation of several minor characters in the book. So \"being gay\" is an invention of the show. But at least not being \"open\" about it fits the portrayed time. Noone in the 50s would admit it openly for fear of  their life. \n\nBut considering that, I think it was as clear as it could be.",

        "text": "In terms of its structure, Queen's Gambit is a sports movie. And I want to make the argument that the sports movie it most resembles is Rocky IV: Beth is Rocky, Borgov is Ivan Drago, and Benny Watts is Adrianne.\n\nSports movies have an arc in which the stakes and action rise towards a climactic 'championship game.' The protagonist suffers a series of setbacks. The opponent is built up as unbeatable. A secondary character (usually a love interest) abandons the protagonist, who must face the big game alone, and then has a change of heart and swoops in to provide last-minute support. Against all odds, the protagonist wins the big game.\n\nAll of these elements are present in both Queen's Gambit and Rocky IV.\n\n - Borgov is steely, remote, emotionless and terrifying; Drago the same, more machine than man.\n\n- Beth withdraws into alcohol and pills; Rocky withdraws to a remote cabin where he has to train by pulling logs through the snow. (This is the weakest of the parallels, since Rocky can't be shown to use alcohol and pills.)\n\n- Benny Watts tells Beth to get lost, then calls during the final match to plot strategy; Adrianne is furious at Rocky for going to Russia, then has a change of heart and shows up in Moscow to cheer Rocky on. Both Beth and Rocky face the final match with new vigor thanks to the return of and support from their love interests.\n\nBut the area in which I think two movies are most alike is in how the Soviet Union is portrayed.\n\nChess is a religion in Russia and the matches are played in a (much classier) version of Caesar's Palace, with a huge crowd inside and a bigger crowd outside. It's essentially a Colosseum in which foreign chess players are fed to the lions.\n\nIn Rocky IV, the prestige of the Soviets is on the line. Drago is able to train using equipment that is so high tech, and anabolic steroids that are so effective, that it puts US training methods to shame. And the match is played in an enormous hall with the premier and entire Politburo watching.\n\nWhen Beth wins, she also wins the hearts of the Russian people (especially the women, if you look at the people who wait outside to applaud and ask for autographs). When Rocky wins, the Russians in the crowd are also won over.\n\nIs this a stretch? Does anyone or disagree? Queen's Gambit is definitely a sports movie (just like Die Hard is a Christmas movie). The more controversial part is that the relevant comparison is to Rocky IV.\n\n(Yes, Rocky IV is a terrible movie, while Queen's Gambit is genius, but in terms of structure and the buildup of the Soviet Union they are quite similar.)\n\nThe two movies are alike not only because of the championship game aspect, but because the Soviet Union is built up as an empire that can't be defeated, yet is.",

Like Rocky IV, it's a Cold War sports movie, which creates all the parallels.     \n      \nThere are a couple of very significant differences tho. First, Queen's Gambit is a story about addiction and attachment much moreso than it is about competition and chess. Second, Queen's Gambit treats the Soviet Union wit a hundred times more empathy than Rocky IV and the rest of Cold War sports movies.",

We certainly saw that with Beth in Queens Gambit. Not so much in Rocky IV, as there's not a lot of subtlety to the Rocky character.\n\nIn terms of the sympathy for the Soviets in the Cold War, the 40-year gap between the two stories really comes through. In the 1980s, it might have been somewhat plausible that the Russians had all of the advanced training techniques used to create Ivan Drago. The  portrayal of the Soviets in Queens Gambit is almost nostalgic, a high point in what we now know was a soon to be shattered empire.\n\nI've read that Queens Gambit was quite popular in Russia, and one of the things they liked about it was the sympathy with which the Russians were portrayed.\n\nI'm wondering when Tevis wrote the book. If he wrote it in the 1980s, he certainly had great empathy for chess in the Soviet Union. Of course he was a chess player himself, so I suppose that's not surprising.",

By the end of the show it\u2019s not really obvious if she is still interested in any of those previously mentioned",

When Beth has finally overcome her demons and achieved her goals, she meets him and sits down to play *another* game.\n\nI'm not suggesting the character actually IS god, just a bit of symbolism.",

However, there are several things about the story that annoyed me because to me they just make no sense.\n\nTwo years after first watching it, I finally read the book, and I was quite shocked to see that pretty much all of the things that annoyed me are not in the book. In no particular order:\n\n* Cleo and the drunken night in Paris - from what I've read online, this doesn't make sense to anybody. Totally absent from the book.\n* The twins - In episode 1 they seem awed by 1800s. Then in episode 4 one of them is playing at a top level invitational tournament in Mexico. And why on earth were they in Benny's apartment at the end (I can just about accept Harry being there)? Again, not in the book.\n* Beth's father? Despite the fact that she was at his house shortly before the car crash, he was never mentioned again. In the book he was dead.\n* Tranquilizers improving Beth's chess ability - How can a drug designed to knock you out, help you to focus? In the book she takes the pills to help her sleep, and avoids taking them too close to playing.\n* Beth getting the money from Jolene - Are we expected to believe that the US establishment would not have found the money to send their best player to Russia. In the book Beth has enough money to travel, but is looking for extra to bring Benny as her second.\n* Townes going to Moscow at short notice - So Beth almost couldn't travel due to lack of funds, but Townes gets a visa and travels over on a whim. In the book this doesn't happen and we never see Townes again after Las Vegas.\n* Some of the announcer's commentary not matching the actual chess being played - Seems they used different games on the board, but took the commentary verbatim from the book.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are even more that I can't think of right now, but the funniest difference from the book has to be the thing that Netflix were sued over and settled, the fact that Nona Gaprindashvili never faced men. In the book it says she has faced all the Soviet GMs many times. I nearly fell off my chair when I read that one.\n\nI can understand the need to omit or shorten certain parts of the story to adapt it for TV. I can understand the need to make Beth much more glamorous than she is in the book. But the things above were changed for no good reason, and make no sense.\n\nI'm sure I will watch the series again, but I'm left a bit annoyed by the needless changes.",

As I haven't read the book, I can't comment on the accuracy of the adaptation beyond those listed points, but so far I had the impression that most people who knew the book beforehand were very pleased about the adaptation.  \n\n\nRegarding some of the changes: I absolutely love how Townes appears in Moscow, and all her boys coming together at Benny's in the end to help her is probably my most favourite part of the whole series. All those men were part of her path to success, and she learned something from all of them, be it in regards of chess or lessons about life, love, humanity itself.  \nHaving them be there for her made her story so worthwhile. It was just a great pay-off, same as her depending on drugs before realizing that she had never really needed them because her genius came from *inside* of her.",

One thing the show left out, wisely in my opinion, is >!when Jolene attempts to have sex with Beth. It would have introduced all kinds of controversy in today's climate, and would have made it completely impossible for Jolene to return later as a wholly positive character. At the time the book was written, most readers would have seen that event the way the author intended, as a clumsy youthful sexual exploration typical institutions. I'm definitely not saying that modern audiences are wrong to be less forgiving, not at all. Society needs to reckon with sexual assault. So the show left that bit out, and I agree with the decision.!<",

This was the height of the cold war and the Russians would have had hundreds of ways to fuck her up if they wanted to.\n\nThe book has her perfectly prepared and playing the best chess of her life against Borgov in Paris and still losing. I much prefer this and I think it fits in with the overall story much better.",

I agree that Townes showing up in Moscow and seeing all the guys in the apartment made for great TV, and I loved it the first time I saw it. But when you watch something 5 times, you notice things that don't seem right.\n\nThere was never any indication given that the twins and Benny were even acquainted with each other, and the twins were clearly at a level of chess far below Benny, a level that they wouldn't have been any help at all in that situation.\n\nFWIW, I really enjoyed the book, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the show.\n\nAnd, so that I'm fair, I will say that there were some parts that were done far better by the show. E.g. Beth's return to the basement after Mr. Shaibel's death, and the final scene with the old men in the park, probably my two favorite scenes in the show, both I found to be flat and boring in the book.",

Reading through literature, filtering for information about Borgov's playstyle and how other players had solved similar situations in the past? So that they were mainly there for the research part, not so much for coming up with a clear strategy which would have been rather Benny's contribution.\n\nThat's what I could imagine as a plausible explanation anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut still, thank you for elaborating on your impressions after reading the book and watching the show so many times!

My interpretation is that since the south was generally a decade or so behind (not so much with the advent of internet) the rest in terms of etiquette, social happenings, schooling etc., she was probably raised with societal 1920s customs. And back then,  people with money did in fact talk like that. So either she was from a well off family (she'd have to have been since she had piano lessons so young) and then she married her husband who was struggling OR she had taught herself to blend with favorable crowds. \n\n Basing this off other works and notes I've read that generally depict the southern customs as \"out of fashion\" by northern standards throughout the decades.",

She's obviously very intelligent, but being so socially withdrawn, and living in such a conformist time and place, she can't really do very much with her mind. She uses the fancy words and convoluted syntax because that's how she thinks, just how her mind works, and the phrases give her some of the only pleasure available to her.\n\nWomen of her era and social class rarely left their husbands. She didn't have any resources of her own, and no one would have hired her for any jobs, especially when she was so dreamy. She was the best possible person to adopt fifteen year old Beth, exactly because she was so unconventional, and so flexible. Who else in that day and age would have allowed Beth to pursue her goals like that? No one.\n\nSometimes the oddball is the only one who will get the job done.",

Her speech is excessively formal AND pretentious and just weird. It's definitely something the writers did deliberately. It doesn't make me dislike (!) her- she's a sad case. A well-meaning person who had a very unhappy life. What's to hate there? She should have left her husband, but she probably had no profession and there was a LOT of stigma to being divorced back in the day, especially for someone from \"respectable society\", so she stuck with this very unhappy marriage and sunk into alcoholism. She didn't hurt anyone else.",

As far as I know, Wednesday has no interest in either chess, drinking, drugs or exploring sexuality and Beth never showed any interest in the macabre. Whenever Beth came in contact with death, it left her traumatized, while Wednesday is delighted by it. \n\nBoth know what they want and what not and don't shy away from challenges, but again, that's no basis for either friendly nor averse reactions. If they meet with a similar goal, they will not hesitate to combine their efforts to reach it. But if they meet with opposing goals, they would fight tooth and nail. \n\nIf they were forced together (for example, forced to be roommates), my guess is, they'd keep their distance from each other while respecting each others privacy. They both have rather silent hobbies (playing chess vs. writing). If anything, they might bond over music. Beth loved listening to Alma playing the piano, so she might love listening to Wednesday playing the cello.",

As it happens I finished Wednesday yesterday. Which means both protagonists are still very much alive in my mind right now and I've just liked the idea of them bumping into each other. Because yes, they do not have that much common ground, I agree on that. From my point of view both of them are very strong minded young individuals who love to set themselves apart from others.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRdgGBJWrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRdgGBJWrw) (Jovi Houska 2023Mar)\n\nSomeone said [Wesley So](https://www.reddit.com/xcdhgq) is the [most inconsistent player](https://imgur.com/a/nfTlh3y) in terms of tournament results. I think it's consistent that [Wesley So](https://reddit.com/wvtrhm)'s been performing so-so in the 3 events between the [2022 Olympiad](https://reddit.com/whnrj6) and the 2022 chessc\\*m [global championship](https://reddit.com/yrhl72) & [2022 meltwater finals](https://reddit.com/z1tj1m), namely\n\n1. [St Louis' Chess9LX](https://reddit.com/xd64d7)\n2. [US Chess Championship](https://uschesschamps.com/2022-us-championships/2022-us-championship) (USCC) and\n3. FIDE World [Fischer Random](https://reddit.com/ybzz7f) Chess '[Championship](https://www.reddit.com/ydwn2y)' (WFRCC),\n\ndespite having been\n\n1. [2nd place in 9LX 2021](https://reddit.com/yc2b5y)\n2. then-reigning and 3-time USCC [and](https://reddit.com/ybrhqj)\n3. Inaugural and then-reigning [WFRCC](https://reddit.com/ybs5li)\n\nThe reason is that [Wesley So](https://reddit.com/x9vwrn) started a secret relationship with 2021 women's [US](https://www.reddit.com/yev3a1)CC Carissa Yip at the Olympiad.\n\n# My basis:\n\nA. These events at the Olympiad:\n\n1. Look at [Carissa](https://twitter.com/carissayipchess)'s Twitter [header](https://reddit.com/xr2bhp). It's a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/qsq5WBE) of just Wesley and Carissa (and Leinier Dom\u00ednguez P\u00e9rez and 1 other).\n2. You can see [Levon Aronian was being Wesley's wingman](https://www.reddit.com/comments/wiij1k/_/iom381y/) when they were teasing Carissa about castling (which is [pretty ironic given what happened later to Wesley](https://reddit.com/yenuil) in the WFRCC, but well I guess it goes to show [how little preparation](https://www.reddit.com/x49iac) Wesley did for the [2019 WFRCC](https://reddit.com/rkhavt)... Anyway...). You can see Levon even makes a 'mistake' in saying that when you castle, the king goes 2 squares, which allows Wesley to say 'unless it's chess960' to flex being the inaugural and then-reigning WFRCC.\n   1. ([Levon also probably has a soft spot for Wesley because Arianne Caoili](https://twitter.com/nicbentulan/status/1469280107386703872/likes), Levon's deceased spouse, was Filipina. RIP.)\n   2. ([Btw, Wesley is still the WFRCC. Hikaru is just the rapid WFRCC. Wesley never lost the title to Hikaru kinda like how Bobby Fischer never lost the title to Anatoly Karpov.](https://www.reddit.com/comments/ym5ogj/_/iv20l6z/))\n3. There's a [Tagalog interview with FM Deniel Causo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vylMndunCa8) where Wesley was asked about romantic relationships, namely if Wesley has a 'special someone'. (Btw, Tagalog interviews of Wesley are pretty rare, so for me I think they're pretty important.) It was probably this interview that gave Wesley a wake up call to finally start a relationship with Carissa.\n\nB. And later in the USCC\n\n* Wesley talks about [how teenagers always play for a win](https://reddit.com/xzdmr5) because they don't have family, bills or GIRLFRIENDS. Wesley laughs at the girlfriends part.\n\nC. Someone [pointed](https://imgur.com/a/nfTlh3y) out to me that at [33:33 of the 2021 USCC closing ceremony Carissa admits to being star struck by Wesley (and Fabi). Take a look at Wesley's reaction to that. Lol. Additionally, look at how Naz\u00ed Paikidze reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBTt8RezzM4). Naz\u00ed probably knew about Carissa's crush on Wesley and was being a wingwoman for Carissa by noting Wesley's reaction to later tell Carissa.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8p5lvp9lig4b1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bba4474b7e50d346a2f9e41cb9fb080274efc9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yep109rmig4b1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5843fe00b116ec49f64c71ba1eecf46f783faa8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3yh7ktnig4b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e5a07d939eccf46e06f516421e094d601a8b289\n\n# So what I guess is:\n\nD. At the Olympiad, they got together, but, because of their 1 decade age gap, they decided to keep their relationship a secret.\n\n* 5 years from now, when Carissa will have graduated from Stanford, their ages 19&29 will become 24&34, the minimum age when the [half your age plus 7 rule is satisfied](https://reddit.com/wf0pkg).\n\nE. But still, since it was both of their 1st times dating, they were very distracted eg talking on the phone all night.\n\n* Notice that Wesley hasn't made any Facebook posts between [the start of the Olympiad](https://www.facebook.com/wesleyso/posts/pfbid02ax1LQcavVUqH4KR9quoQxsqRwW1ZkuaxpsrhnEPYaZetsMxzYuUw19RAKVtD4ECbl) and [the end of the CGC](https://www.facebook.com/wesleyso/posts/pfbid02HxbzoBFZezqGfLckYwejjS2UZjce2eLy6XJHReoK5PLkiEVhfEFpz6LqLy6Qr6Zgl). I guess this is because the time Wesley would've used for Facebook went to talking to Carissa.\n\nF. Anyway, we don't see much of an impact, if any, on Carissa because Carissa stopped playing chess for awhile, in particular didn't defend at the 2022 women's USCC for studies at [Stanford](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/07/07/carissa-yip-woman-chess-player-special/7828795001/). But, well, we did see much impact on Wesley in placing only\n\n1. 5th out of 10 in 9LX,\n2. 6th of 14 in USCC and\n3. 6th of 8 in WFRCC\n\nThe WFRCC underperformance was the last straw. It was like the [Beth and Cleo thing in The Queen's Gambit](https://the-queens-gambit.fandom.com/wiki/Adjournment). Wesley and Carissa decided to slow down their relationship. And then voil\u00e0 Wesley wins $200,000 in the CGC and can now fully celebrate with Carissa. (I'd argue it wasn't really an '[underperformance](https://www.reddit.com/ydwn2y)' but that maybe Wesley isn't so good at 25min 9LX compared to the original 45min 9LX. Also, Wesley was likely NOT underperforming *outside* of chess. Lol.)\n\nG. After Meltwater finals, I bet Wesley and Carissa are celebrating a lot more.\n\nH. Finally, Wesley said in an interview with Dina Belenkaya during the FIDE Grand Prix ('[I am not afraid of Hikaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI6xuDHn68)') that Wesley's mom, Lotis Key, didn't want Wesley to use Twitter.\n\n* Who else but Carissa (your new girlfriend/romantic partner) could've convinced Wesley (yourself) to defy [Lotis](https://reddit.com/tz4fxw) (your mom/parent - not [bio mom](https://reddit.com/z9u9ts) though) ?\n\n\\---\n\n**inb4**: 'This might be the oddest obsession i've seen' - [fgdadfgfdgadf](https://reddit.com/comments/j1qp0e/_/g729pze/) re TehTex's [removed comment](https://reddit.com/rwmtsq) about [Wesley and Alireza](https://reddit.com/xf1b1j).\n\n\\---\n\n# Some feedback: [see images in wordpress]\n\n1.

(SPOILER AHEAD)\n\n\nIn the novel there is at least one very big difference in Beth\u2019s scene with Jolene after her fall from grace into a drunken mess. In the show, Jolene magically deus ex machina\u2019s herself onto Beth\u2019s doorstep. In the novel, Beth seeks out Jolene. She calls the orphanage and begs the headmistress for Jolene\u2019s phone number so she can call her. This shows the difference in the morals of the two works. If you suffer from addiction, depression, the NOVEL says that the first step to getting better is seeking help. You cannot hope that someone will magically show up on your doorstep and fix all your problems because life doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to actively search for help and make an effort to improve first. In the SHOW, the solution IS to wait for someone to magically show up at your doorstep. Do not worry about your addiction because someone will come and help solve all your problems. \nI see this as the major moral flaw of the adaptation. There are more examples highlighting this but I believe this one best illustrates my point.",

                "comment_text": "Everything surrounding Cleo in Paris I didn't really like. It lead to way too many suspicions that she's a KGB plant to distract Beth and I thought the notion of \"she didn't beat Borgov because of her hangover. *If only* she stayed sober...\" had so much less impact than how it went down in the book. Yes, they rectify it with a line when she talks to Benny, but still, the impression is there.\n\nOn the other hand, one aspect I do like about it is, that Beth is portrayed more like an addict in this instance. In the book, it felt to me more like she can turn the addiction (or at least the excesses) on and off at will.\n\nAnd I agree that Jolene \"magically\" turning up cheapens Beths overcoming her problem a lot. If your focus is on that, then I can start to \"fathom\". For me, the focus of the show was more about Beths inability to connect with other people on more than a surface level. (One thing that *I* can relate to much more than drug addiction. Maybe that's the reason I see it different from you)\n\nI think the focus of the finale was for Beth to learn, accept and embrace, that people really do care about her. Jolene, Mr. Shaibel, even the drug store owner, and especially Beltik and Watts & Co.\n\nI think this is also part of the \"meaning\" of the book. I did not read TQG as \"prodigy overcomes addiction\" but as \"troubled soul finds its way in life\", with all the \"accepting yourself\", \"accepting others\", \"accepting others accepting you\" that comes with it. So again, for me, the show didn't botch the meaning, it just shifted the focus.",

                "comment_text": "Oh yeah, the Cleo section. Honestly, I found her so forgettable and pointless to the show that I didn\u2019t even realize she doesn\u2019t exist in the book. XD\n\nAs for the show portraying Beth as an addict more clearly than the book, this is true. But I would disagree that she was able to \u201cturn the addiction on or off at will\u201d. I believe the book does an excellent job highlighting her drug use and foreshadowing her overcoming her addiction, especially in relation to Beth\u2019s chess ability. We\u2019re shown in the show from the very beginning that Beth struggles to win without drugs from a very young age. Of course she has talent - immense talent at that - but during her lessons with Mr. Shaibel, the simul at the school,  and her match against Beltik she uses drugs to help her win. In fact, I would say in the show she would have lost against Beltik without the aid of her drugs. This leads to two assumptions from the audience: 1) Beth may be talented, but she needs drugs to be able to focus and win and 2) Beth shows no ability thus far to possibly overcome her addiction (with relation to using drugs for chess). In the book, another key difference is that Beth does NOT use drugs to beat Beltik, proving to the reader the opposite of the show: 1) Beth\u2019s chess skill is not tied to her drug use and 2) She does not have to rely on drugs and has the strength to win without them. \n\nThis makes much more sense for the scene later in the book where Beth seeks out Jolene, it is a logical follow-through about what we know of her character. Similarly, this is why the show needed Jolene to deus ex machina herself on Beth\u2019s doorstep, because TV Beth DIDN\u2019T have the strength to seek out help. But the biggest problem in the show (I think) was that it doesn\u2019t show that Beth herself believes she has any ability to win without her drugs. She may SAY that she\u2019s better than her opponents, but her actions show that when she faces tough opponents such as Benny and Borgov, she struggles and loses without drugs. The one truly difficult match she wins without drugs is against Benny, but by then I would argue it is too late for establishing Beth true ability.\n\nAs for the focus of the show, I understand that part of Beth\u2019s struggles is her inability to deeply connect with other people. But I think that her struggle is tied directly to her addictions. Her addictions being drugs, alcohol, chess, and even her ego. \n\nOn a surface level, it is clear Beth is addicted to alcohol and drugs. The alcohol helps her feel good when she\u2019s sad and the drugs help her focus during chess. \n\nThe less clear but still noticeable addiction is chess. While playing chess is not inherently a bad thing, I would be remiss if I did not bring up Paul Morphy\u2019s famous quote: \u201cThe ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life\u201d. An important warning by one of the best chess players of all time that devoting one\u2019s life to being the best at any single thing will force you to miss out and sacrifice many other great parts of life. \n\nBut the most important addiction I believe Beth suffers from is her tying her self-worth to her chess ability. It is a precarious thing, tying one\u2019s self-worth to an ability or skill, because the world is a vast place and you might risk losing yourself and your reason for existing if you meet others better than you. Beth\u2019s entire existence from a very young age had been centered around chess. Her loss against Borgov crushes her and leads her to a downward spiral where she all but gives up on chess. Perhaps the show\u2019s main focus was meant to be her overcoming her addiction, with the deeper meaning being related to a universal struggle people go through when they lose their reason for existing or question their entire worldview.\n\nBut if it was not and it was about Beth accepting herself, others, and others\u2019s acception, how did the show portray that well? Beth had a good relationship with Mr. Shaibel and clearly cared for him even after his death. She willingly got close to Benny and let him help her. She even grew closer with Beltik when he came and she willingly accepted his help. And she readily accepted Jolene\u2019s help. Beth (in the show) never asked for help, she was simply offered it and accepted it.  I don\u2019t think Beth struggled with accepting herself or others\u2019s care or anything of the like. I believe she struggled with accepting her own flaws. And I believe this struggle came from the drug addiction that led her to overestimate her abilities from a young age. It\u2019s very difficult to believe that she: had the skills to win on her own when she relied on drugs to beat even someone easy like Beltik, could overcome her drug addiction even with the help of others, or that she had trouble accepting help from others.\n\nI still think the theme of both stories is about addiction, physical vices and an attachment to one\u2019s sense of self, and learning to have the strength to give up those vices and be willing to grow as a person.\n\nWith that said, what do you think?",

She seemed to hold a lot of grudges and didn\u2019t get along with people that well. \n\nThere were a lot of great scenes. One for me was when Beth says to Luchenko that it was an honor to play him and he goes \u201cAll this, it\u2019s not like chess at all\u201d and she smiles \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d \n\nBut my favorite scene was when she was in bed in Benny\u2019s apartment, and she was thinking about a beautiful queen promotion strategy while ignoring a couple outside hurling horrible insults at each other. I took it to mean that in this ugly world of pettiness, misogyny, and conflict, at least Beth had something infinite, beautiful, and transcendental to devote herself to: the game of chess. \n\nSorry for the essay, just thought the story was masterful and needed to vent lol",

It also had the timer ticking throughout the whole scene. I feel like it was supposed to make the audience feel something or to portray Beth in a specific way but I have never been able to figure it out.",

For those of us that had good and present parents growing up, they feel like an omnipresent safety net standing between you and the horrors of the world that you're not prepared to handle on your own. They wanted us to see the insecurity and terror she felt at the idea of losing her mom, well before she had any solid reasoning for the concern. Your parents are the ones who shape how you fundamentally see the world as a human being and guide you to becoming who you are. As a kid, losing a parent would be like the Earth falling apart beneath your feet.\n\nIt just makes it so much more gut-wrenching to see what she has to go through after the car crash, with basically no one to talk to or help her make sense of it. And while Beth ended up with a lot of meaningful people in her life, the fear of losing her mother just shows how alone she must have felt.",

It shows the viewer the bond they had, which illustrates how painful the loss of her mother was. And also that Beth always has and probably always had a sense of doom, that her mother would leave and not come back. It was unclear to me if this was a flashback of an actual memory, or a dream,  but either way that scene is so poignant and very hard for me to watch, both as a mother and a daughter.",

A TON was put into the episode. TQG could have easily been an episode longer.\n\nThe line was used to make it make more sense that Beth would beat Borgov.\n\nWe must also remember that Beth played chess with Mr. Shaibel (sp?) on Sunday for a few months or whatever, played with the teacher a few times, did that simultaneous thing with the high school chess club, but that was it for her for 6 years. She read her *Modern Chess Openings* book, maybe other chess books, but she didn't even play chess with anyone for around 6 years. And she didn't have those green pills during that time.",

Anything from \"hormonal changes during pregnancy\" to \"having a baby pushed her out of academia\" to \"fallout with father\" goes. \n\nBeth clearly thinks it's her fault her birth mother committed suicide. (\"you're a rounding error\"). But the way Alice talks about \"men\", I think the father plays a big role in her mental spiraling downwards, too. Him refusing (or \"forgetting\") to call her \"Beth\" might indicate that there were more disagreements about how to raise Beth. Now, if Alice leaving the father caused her breakdown or the breakdown caused her leaving... who knows. \n\nNow if you ever talked with a single mother, especially one in financial distress, you don't need much imagination to connect the dots of what an already fragile seeming psyche leads to suicide.",

However a well to do family of the past wouldn't want an intelligent woman with a career. A woman's job was to keep a pretty house, keep pretty children, and at most be witty enough to entertain her husband's friends and reflect well on him at a dinner party but not be smart enough to show any of them up. Alice Harmon did not want this and couldn't stand it. We can see her telling Beth in flashbacks that people will \"try to make you do what they want you to do.\" But that she wants Beth to have the freedom to be who she wants.\u00a0\nIt's unclear if it was having a child she didn't really want, being in a marriage situation that did not suit her, or just being mentally ill from the beginning was the cause, but she was eventually driven far enough into depression that suicide became her solution.\u00a0\nShe didn't truly want to kill Beth. We can see that she tried to get her biological father to take her in, but at that point he had remarried, had the 'right kind of wife' and a new baby. He had tried to get involved when Beth was younger but when Alice refused he cut ties. So knowing she couldn't care for herself and Beth, that no one was going to help them and that her options as a single mother were incredibly limited, she thought death was the only way out for them both. Perhaps she even thought that Beth's future would inevitably look like hers and thought death was saving her the pain to come.",

But the numbers who would avoid her for a year or two would be huge, HOWEVER once she got a high enough rating that would go away for most imo and even become an attraction. At 2100 or so she would not be a threat to a masters ratings given her rep and standing. **EDIT**: A huge percentage of chess masters back then would have had  Jobs, families, and travel expenses would make them bad picks for anything not local. That meant those who lived in the Northeast corridor had a much easier time of playing enough to maintain their ratings. Most of the remaining good players, excepting those who were wealthy, would travel infrequently and attend tournaments where there lots of other highly ranked players so they could play as many ranked opponents with a minimum of travel..\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_I consider TQG more-or-less realistic.

Those barely exist now in this country and didn't exist at all back then unless there were strings attached like with that church and the Russia trip.\n\nMoving on the house business was pretty unrealistic. No bank would have lent her the money. She was in effect making a living as a gambler and they wouldn't touch her in a normal loan situation. The only way I can see that happening, and I am seriously stretching reality, would be if;\n\n1. the loan was assumable (like a G.I. Bill loan), there is less paper shuffling on this kind of thing.\n2. the amount Beth paid (the equity) was a huge percentage of the outstanding principal. This actually isn't all that unbelievable if the Wheatley's had been in that house at least 10 years.  I'm from Lexington and as it happens my parents bought a new 4 bdrm house in 1966 for $21,500.  The Wheatley's house was older (pre-war), looked like it was 3 bdrm  and probably was sold to them for $10-12 thousand if it was bought 1950-57. If it was all the way back in the mid 1940's  the price would have been even less which reduces the risk a lot.\n\nLet me make this clear. The house on the open market would have been wortha fair amount  more than when it was bought. But Mr. Wheatley was selling itat the original cost to him. That would make the purchase less risky to thebank.\n\n3.  Whoever reviewed Beth's loan papers was willing to take a hit if it went south.which ime is very unlikely.",

Which is provably wrong. But it is presented in a way that the general audience, not familiar with the details, would take it as a fact. \n\nNow forgive me, I'm not too familiar with what Magnus said or didn't say exactly (and no, I won't work my way through all those URLs...), but that's also not the point that is made here. \n\nThe statement made here is \"Magnus can get sued for writing fiction (containing defaming falsehoods) about Hans and presenting it as fact\". \n\nThe statement does ***not*** say \"Magnus ***did*** write fiction \\[...\\] and presented it as fact, so now he can be sued\". \n\nThe statement can be reformed to say \"***If*** what Magnus did was recognized as writing fiction \\[...\\], the Netflix/Nona case ***can*** (now) be used as precedence to sue him\". Which, I would say, is a true statement (although: IANAL). \n\nNow, apart from that, you say Magnus *accused* Hans (of cheating). And I'm going to trust you on that. If he really did that clearly and openly and without the shadow of a doubt (just \"implying\" it is a different case), then he could already (before the Netflix/Nona case) be sued for defamation and would then have the burden to proof that it was really cheating. \n\nIn sports, basically all reputation is built upon playing fair. The simple act of being accused of cheating can destroy a career or at least severely damage it. So the one doing the accusing better have some hard evidence to support that accusation. And the accused has almost no other choice but to sue for defamation in hopes of saving their reputation.

Nowadays it's something that is on everyones mind, at least to some degree and there are very strong feelings and opinions about it on all sides. A good storyteller picks up on \"current topics\" and work them into their creations. Either making their point about it abundantly clear, or showing different sides, letting the readers/viewers see that there are other opinions than their own. Not-so-good storytellers see that \"it's a thing now\" and latch on to it. \n\nEither way, it is \"everywhere\" to the point, as you noticed, where people are surprised, when it *isn't* there. Right now, it's still \"popular\", so more of it is produced. And let's not forget that it *is* a thing that still happens to a lot of people. I don't think we're getting desensitized. Quite the opposite. We are now much more aware of it. \n\nNow for the other thing, and I hate that it's there and I don't really understand why it is, but there is a scene in the book in the orphanage where inappropriate things happen to Beth. The only explanation I could think of is, that it ties into the subplot of Beth discovering her own sexuality, but it must have been icky then and it is definitely horrible now. And I am *very* glad they did not include it in the show (where otherwise almost every scene from the book made it faithfully into the show. Especially early on. (it get's murky in Paris and onwards)).",

Just as there was US teamwork for the last game, maybe there'll be US teamwork in developing 9LX.\n2. Also in the series finale, there's a line about [endgames](https://redd.it/wpvusw):\n\n>If they play on, once the dust settles and the endgame emerges, she could find herself in a very different position. Borgov is death on endgames. He\u2019s famous for it. Harmon, on the other hand, is not. She\u2019s more known for coming up early and strong, demoralizing her opponents from the start.\n\n**Maybe someone like Borgov** who's 'death on endgames' would come up with something.\n\nxlury3, xlurxc, xlurtv, xlva6x, xm7f63, xm7gor",

I saw a LOT of gyms.\n\nHere is my \"they screwed that up\". Even small schools in the less affluent counties had hardwood floors. not the ugly multiple purpose composite ones shown during the chess tournament in Ep 2. You were not allowed to walk on them in shoes with nails in the heels and smoking on them would have gotten you asked to leave the venue. The only exception I can imagine would be if they laid down a tarp and even that's iffy. So the chess tournament as it was staged was impossible.\n\nBut that said people did smoke like chimneys. I was one of them.",

Beth's intelligence and intellect to have her move beyond chess or stay in chess. It was a show also about 'female empowerment'.\n\nI had suggested that Beth could go into high finance.

VERY pro-woman and even feminist.\n\nI was touched by the scene where the woman gave Beth vcredit for her decision to enter medical school.  Ironically placed where Beth was near the bottom of her meltdown.\n\nI suspect to most people, that scene was at best nice.  I know my son (in his 30s) didn't get the significance of it.\n\nIn the 60s, women going to medical school was VERY rare.  Women were expected to marry and have kids - and if they wanted to work, they were almost expected to take \"woman appropriate\" jobs (secretary, teacher, nurse).  Nothing wrong with those jobs obviously, but a woman being inspired to break through those stereotypes and enter into a male-dominated field was significant.  It showed Beth - without realizing it - touched the lives of people she didn't even know.\n\nAnd I loved the fact that those points were made without beating us over the head with it.",

Beth has like no negative reaction to Townes's being gay. Maybe Mr. Shaibel is a Jew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of Beth's being a girl, it is addressed in the show. Mr. Shaibel tells her, \"Girls don't play chess.\" The twins tell her there's no \"women's section\" or whatever. Beth gets respect because she's a good player. It's implied a reason Beth gets so much attention is because of how unique it was to have a girl who looks like Anya Taylor-Joy be so excellent at chess. If anything, Beth could have likely gotten some endorsements.\n\nMisogyny, sexism, chauvinism, etc. exist. But it's not as if Eleanor Roosevelt wasn't respected. Catherine the Great is generally considered one of the and possibly the best Russian monarch and leader. Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria are generally considered the best English monarchs.\n\nChess players want to play the best. That Beth was a girl who looks like ATJ was incorporated in the show and incorporated well.",

Nevertheless Beth was some real world champion material, you don't get that good in chess without resilience and determination and she had plenty of them.\n\nI\u2019m not really familiar with women's condition in the US 60's, but i will say this, in competitive chess the thing that matters the most is your ability to beat your opponents and players are usually expected to maintain high levels of sportivity. Beth in the series was so dominant that i like to think everybody would accept her superiority or silently cry in frustration.\n\nThere\u2019s a Bobby Fischer video of 1972, the year he became world champion, talking about sexism in chess. (definitely too optimistically though).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv1WSXjZSkw&ab\\_channel=GoodKnightChess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv1WSXjZSkw&ab_channel=GoodKnightChess)\n\nAn interesting story is that Bobby Fischer became the youngest grandmaster in history in 1958, 33 years later, the young Judit Polgar beat his record and became GM at 15 year and 4 months, she is still regarded as the best female player in history.\n\nJudit Polgar was the 4th woman to become a grandmaster, and after her sister Susan, the second to get it the standard way (the first two achieved it through winning the women's chess championship).\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about the woman Fischer is talking about in the video:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nona\\_Gaprindashvili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nona_Gaprindashvili)",

A woman came up to her and said she was one of the first (I think) to get beaten by Beth at a school tournament (or something similar) sometime before .  This woman took inspiration from Beth (I assume in effect a woman entering and succeeding in what is considered a male world) and pursued her own dream\n\nNow the BRILLIANCE of the writing etc to me was in scenes like that.  It made a vERY important point but it happened naturally.  No narration explaining the significance etc.\n\nA LOT of examples of that style of story telling (geared more toward realism than drama.  The fact Benny was thinking of chess - to Beth's disappointment - after they engaged in sex.  Obviously in contrast to Beth doing the same to Harry.  And the biggest to me - the fact that Beth didn't pay back Schaibel - which actually led her to go back to the orphanage (where she swore she'd never do) and realize he cared enough to follow her career.  No \"Rocky\" style music as she began to get herself together.  no corny dialog.  Just sincere tears to Jolene - whose role was understated in a way too (again, no corny \"how can I ever repay you\" lines.)\n\nEDIT - I assume you caught the significance of her wearing checks (\"safety within the 64 squares\") until her triumph where she dress like a chess piece queen s she went into the park.  That was probably the most overt references to me - especially her saying (in Russian) \"Let's play\".\n\nAt first, the chessboard was her world.  At the end, the world was her chessboard.",

(That doesn't mean it's not \"true\", just that it's overused). \n\nBut the book makes a different point there. Being good at chess (or anything else), is a *process*. Yes, talent helps and Beth was born with a lot of it, but that just means she has a head start. And progresses *faster* than others. But the book makes it very clear, even under the best circumstances, she is not ready yet in Paris. And knowing that almost destroys her (mentaly and then, turning to drugs and alcohol again, physically). \n\nThis harsh reality of \"someone is better than you, even if you five it your all\" goes against the usual dream of \"if you put effort in, you will succeed\". And I like, that the book goes into that much less explored direction, where the show opted for the tried and true way.",

Even TQG 1.06 felt a little rushed. TQG 1.07 felt very rushed and very condensed.\n\nBut my point remains. Beth in Paris knew she wasn't good enough to beat Borgov. But that in itself wouldn't have resulted in hers spiraling after losing to him. It makes sense that hers subconsciously self-sabotaging herself, arriving to the match late, not being fully focused, etc. would bring self-hatred to herself and result in hers drinking and such. She loved her celebrity and she probably got endorsements, yet she wasn't doing talk shows, etc.\n\nIt makes the ending make more sense. She had already lost to Borgov in Mexico. She had told Cleo in Paris that Beth would be world champion in a few years. A sober Beth losing to Borgov wouldn't be that big of a deal.",

The championships were covered by the mainstream magazines and newspapers. Every newspaper had a chess puzzle in it next to the crossword. My local library had maybe 20 chess books, and a big bookstore might stock another dozen on the shelves. I was in a chess club that had maybe 50 regular members, which was pretty good for a suburban town.\n\nBut the serious players were in a very different world. Chess magazines were aimed at serious players and were definitely a niche market, kind of like a quilting magazine might be today. Once Fisher faded away, chess languished. I doubt the average person then would even recognize the name of the world champion.\n\nChess is actually pretty big now, probably even bigger than it was back then. It's really flourished in the online gaming world. I think it helps that we've had non-Russian champions in recent years.",

The US vs. Russia thing was really played up by Fisher himself, who basically accused the Russians of setting up the championship tournament to rig it so only Russians could win. \n\nA few times, I think I remember him accusing them of outright cheating. But that might've been part of the mind-game he was playing. The Russians legitimately played fantastic chess.\n\nRemember that adjournment scene with Borgov in Queen's Gambit? The adjournment rules are an example of the Russians gaming the system. If a Russian player ever got in trouble in a big game, he'd ask for an adjournment and then the entire Russian team would spend all night analyzing the board to come up with the best continuation. It was not uncommon for 8 of the top 10 players in the world to all be Russian, so that gave them a big advantage over other country's players during the adjournment. I'm not positive about this, but I think Fisher had nobody to help him. It was him alone against a half-dozen of the top players in the world. \n\nJust as another aside about what chess was like back then ... I think many people knew how to play chess. There weren't as many board games then as there are now, and casual chess is easy to learn. When I was very young, I remember I had a teenage babysitter - probably a 15-year-old girl - teach me how to move the knights! There was probably an old chessboard stuck in the back of a closet somewhere in a lot of homes, next to the Monopoly and Clue.",

He played it like checkers though looking back - I mean his moves were correct but they were almost random.  It got easy to trap him and he stopped playing when I got to that point.\n\nDidn't' play much then until high school where I found one of my friends loved the game too.  We had Friday night \"pizza and chess\" nights often.\n\nFast forward to my younger son loving the game and playing for his HS club and finishing high for his ranking in the state tournament.  Got a commendation from our suburb's city council.\n\nAnd to go full circle - now grown and married, he was the one who texted me a couple years ago and said \"Dad - you have GOT to watch this series on Netflix!!!\"\n\nI'll see him this weekend - I need to ask him if he's taught either of his children the game yet.",

I had no idea he was an author until reading a book review in the newspaper.  This is one of my fondest memories, chess-related or otherwise.  Sadly he died the next year.",

Afterwards Harry tells her that was a mistake, presumably because Borgov is such a good Sicilian player. But Beth is young and cocky, and just plays what she knows best.\nIn their rematch, she has the white pieces, and she's wiser, so she plays d4, not playing her normal opening, but depriving him the opportunity to play the Sicilian against her.",

At first it seemed like Townes was sending some serious signals to Beth in the hotel room, and it was obvious that she had a crush on him. Then Roger walks in. Are we suppose to interpret this as Townes is possibly bi, and was about to cheat on his partner? Or is he gay and Beth was misinterpreting the situation? In Russia he says Beth confused him, I saw this as he was blown away by her talent and maybe he mistook that as him being attracted to her. But his behaviour was still a little weird to me in the hotel, was he just leading her on? But what would he gain from that? I\u2019m not sure what they were trying to do, but the ending meant to me that he was gay and I guess Beth was over her unrequited love? I only recently finished the show so sorry if this has been posted before.",

Throughout the show, when there's a scene in which one person is wearing white and another black (or red - the other common color for the black pieces in chess) the person in white will generally be leading that interaction - making the first move. How is that relevant? Well, because Townes is wearing a black sweater. Then he takes it off to reveal a white shirt. Watch Beth's reaction to that - the camera focuses on her, so it's significant - she looks like she now expects him to make a move.\n\nThen Roger comes in. The key moment is when he reminds Townes what time dinner is - and Townes' reaction to that reminder. Does Townes strike you as someone who would forget what time dinner is? Hardly. So why does Roger tell Townes what time he'll be coming back to the room? He's giving Townes permission to have sex with Beth and make sure they're finished by then so he doesn't walk in on them. Townes looks ever so slightly exasperated at Roger here. My read is that Beth understands what is going on but they do not sleep together.\n\nTownes guilt is over him inadvertently leading Beth on. I suppose it's also possible they had sex that one time and it didn't go well or didn't lead to anything, but it's unlikely something so significant would have been left implicit. And I'm probably overthinking it, but then quality TV encourages you to think.",

It's more about the psychology of the character than about the actual game, but it's an absorbing film. \n\nOTOH, the one other recent chess movie available on Netflix is The Coldest Game (2019), starring Bill Pullman. That one is an unmitigated disaster. They get even the basics wrong (Apparently, googling for 5 minutes was too much effort for the screenwriter).",

The description continues: \"This beautiful board is the same one used in the 1968 final of the Tournament of Champions held in Moscow where protagonist Beth Harmon defeats Russian chess champion Vasily Borgov.\"\n\nI had a good laugh. As all fans of \"The Queen's Gambit\" should know by now, the boards used for the scenes of the Moscow tournament were new ones, made by Rechapados Ferrer. Apart from that the whole story of course is entirely fictional. I'm still not sure whether the seller was trying to dupe someone naive enough to not see through this madness, or if he intended it as a joke. \ud83d\udcf7 Maybe not, because I confronted the seller after the board had been sent, and he sort of pretended that he wasn't in on the joke.\n\nAnyway, I liked the style of the board enough, and the end price was right, so I won the auction. A real board made by a fictitious company for a fictitious tournament in a fictional TV show - irresistible. I also knew the craftsmanship was a bit on the rough side, but I bought it for the fun of it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtkh1f1w3z791.jpg?width=3227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44660c0138c2455a33c5f161bc6dd6b16b73a715\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vp6qef1w3z791.jpg?width=3970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18eaa8bd86f5f212d111a99b116bdd0b587c95cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/260obb1w3z791.jpg?width=3710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0160fc32e59a3a23ab81a14b99442e69e86b3dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1efeyc1w3z791.jpg?width=3020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=842b71fd21fa9d624b00e77d76cb18984c434c65\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8jkhz1w3z791.jpg?width=3665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddadd131c73bb1316c774aee1b13accfb8702c97\n\nYep, it really comes with a massive \"HARMON\" sign attached to the back. I also think I've seen that logo before, possibly in connection with the character/show. I'm sure one or more copyright infringements are involved here, too, but let's not go into those right now.\u00a0\n\nTo the seller's credit, his original photos didn't gloss over the rough edges in the workmanship. The board isn't made of individual chunks of wood; rather, what they did was laminate each square independently onto a single massive wood or MDF \"plank\". The board is quite heavy (about 5-6kg on a 46cm x 46cm board with 50mm squares).\n\nI'll never know for sure. I'll probably also never find out who actually makes these boards, and I haven't seen one in this exact style before. Have you? I don't think it's mass-produced, maybe it's made by an enthusiast.\n\nBe that as it may, I think this is a real curiosity item, and since I bought it knowing fully well about its dubious \"credentials\", I am more amused than infuriated with its existence, especially as a huge fan of the show. Still, I am pretty confident the seller didn't really believe someone could be THAT ignorant to believe the fairy tale story around it.",

        "text": "I was confused about few things after watching the series and want to share my thoughts with other people, who else read the book.   \n \n\n1. From the 1st minutes: waking up in a bath, hotel room full of cigarettes butts, alcohol and then rushing to play chess tournament, really? This scene is not realistic, nor taken from the book. I think it was made this way just to capture the viewer's attention, let's present an eccentric character (lives a cool lifestyle, cool looking and doesn't care that everyone waits for her). That's precise description of Beth, right?\n2. Show Beth is so aggressive: she pushed the girls when \"apple pie\" girls were marching trough corridor; she called Mr. Shaibel \"cocksucker\" after loosing; she was so bitter and snide while playing vs Beltik. \n3. Show doesn't explain why she uses the tranquilisers, it doesn't explain her relationship with them. In the show \"pills\" are drugs, she tried them and got addicted. Why? Because these are drugs and everyone gets addicted to them, end of story. While in the book, the author describes her insecurities, how she felt uncomfortable in the new place, she could not sleep, she was literally staring at the celling all night. She was saving the pills for the night because it was the only way for her to \"get rid of that tension in her tommy\", relax and sleep.\n4. I am confused about the deviation from the book:  \n\\- Why did they introduced mother's past? Made her a doctor in math? Decided that mother should suicide - \"close your eyes\"...  \n\\- Added more \"artistic flavor\" to Mrs Wheatley - made her a pianist. To give her a valid reason to stay home all day?  \n\\- What was the point to lie about her age (when she was adopted)?  \n\\- Removed the sexual scene with Jolene. Mrs Deardorff was helping Beth. Why? To make this characters \"likeable\", even if it doesn't fit them?\n\nI am not against adapting books and making movies, but it feels uncomfortable to watch the show called \"The Queen's Gambit\" suggesting it is from the book \"The Queen's Gambit\", yet they are so different. If instead, the show would be called something else or be \"inspired by the book\", I feel the author would have valid reasons to change the characters, as he pleases. Maybe my \"issue\" is that I read the book 1st, have successfully created the world in my head, and THEN saw the show. It surely looked different and also unrealistic. It feels very different and so distant. I read your comments, happy to know other people liked it, even people that read the book. In the show, the Beth is more of a \"pop\" style, easily winning against any opponent. Why? Because her mother has a book in math, because Beth is genius and because she takes pills. To make it better, they added a \"cowboy\" that spends nights by clubbing and play a bit of chess during the day. Does this make sense to you?",

The Queens Gambit is one of the most faithful translations of book material to film ever.\n\nThat said...\n\n1. Yes, I didn't like the whole change in Paris. In the book, Beth is fully sober by then and prepared and on top of her game and still Borgov wipes the floor with her. Imho a much more powerful sequence in the book. And you're right, the main reason is very likely to have an interesting start that hooks the viewers right away. It's sadly a sign of the times of oversupply. If a show doesn't catch the audience in the first five to ten minutes, most people will move on to something else.\n2. Yes, social anxiety expressed by animosity.\n3. Insecurity and umcomfortableness is much harder to show than tell. I got that from the show, too. And if it was *just* \"drugs make you addicted\", then why was it so easy for the other kids to quit? It was much harder for Beth exactly because she needed them much more.\n4.  \n\n* Fully agreed. Hated the trope of \"child of a mad genius is mad herself\". Not needed, Luckily only a very small part of the show.\n* Well, to give Mrs. Wheatly *some* character. The book does not give much about her.\n* When asked if ATJ could pull of a 13 year old, she said no. *Maybe* a 15 year old. But they wanted to get her to play the role as early as possible, so they \"cheated\". I'm fine with that.\n* You really think anyone would be mad enough to show a twelve year old raping an eight year old? Nope! Just nope! To leave this one out was probably the best decision they made.\n\nShe \"easily\" wins in the book, too, most of the time. She does not win in the show \"because\" of the pills (they just calm her down enough). And that cowboy was also a cowboy in the book.\n\nI'm sorry, that the world in your head is different from the show, but for a show, where most scenes start, play out and end exactly as described in the book, with dialog taken word by word and with set design matching the descriptions to the tip of a penis candle, I just can't agree with your assessment that this is not a very faithful adaptation.",

To me, the scene just strongly conveyed some very familiar feeling of \"oh fuck oh fuck I overslept I fucked up fuuuuck I'm late to the important thing!\". It immediately allowed me to relate to Beth, a character that I didn't know and that I have barely anything in common with. Empathizing with the character in turn made me interested in the questions \"Where is she going? What happened last night? How will she deal with whatever lies before her?\"\n\nThis is not to say that the series *had* to start out this way - I just wanted to provide my perspective in which the scene was kinda useful.",

Thus Deardorff lying-- as viewers, we eventually understand that Alma wouldn't have really cared, but most do.\n\nAnd I don't get how you think the first scene was meant to make her look \"cool and eccentric.\" I've never understood how people find substance abuse glamorous, but I got a very different picture of what was being conveyed. A very troubled girl who engages in such destruction right before a clearly important competition-- as viewers, this is kind of like \"now watch as we tell you how she got this point, and if she can redeem herself.\"\n\nEdit to add: Idk how anyone can possibly construe it as *her* being the rude one in that match. Beltik showed up carelessly late for no actual reason, was condescensing, yanwed loudly & dramatically through the beginning of the match, generally acted like she wasn't worth his time. Then he started acting temperamental and aggressive when he realized she was a worthy opponent.\n\nAnd it wasn't \"drugs make you addicted, end of story.\" None of the other children were addicted to them like she was. Even Jolene was sad to see that years later, Beth was still abusing them-- Jolene didn't end up addicted.\n\nMaking Alma a pianist isn't something that should upset people. It gives dimension to her character-- it also shows that she once had a passion & gift, too, but feels she wasn't able to live it: if you notice, she and Beth don't bond at all until she discovers Beth's gift of chess, and it changes their entire relationship. I personally love Alma's character and think they did great with it, from the writing to the casting.",

Not needed, Luckily only a very small part of the show.\n\nThat is a pretty reductionist way of viewing the premise of the show. It's not \"child of a mad genius is mad herself\", personally I even dislike the popular idea that genius=mad always and I think this show is also trying to convey that that idea is not true\\*. The premise of the show is mother who happens to be a genius and is having emotional and probably socio-economical struggles, leaves her child ,who is also a genius (and I don't think this idea is implausible given how intelligence is believed to be largely hereditary), orphaned and traumatized, and with her own set of personal and emotional problems to overcome. And that is what we see in the show. So I disagree with two things: 1. The premise of the show being reduced to a \"trope\" and 2. that it is not needed and a very small part of the show; in my opinion it is one of the most significant underlying themes given how much it affects everything that happens afterwards, Beth's character and worldview and therefore, her actions. \n\n\\*Beth isn't mad or an addict because she's gifted and that's what happens with gifted people, she's and addict because she has suffered a lot through life and that is how she initially learned to cope. If we compare the mother's life to Beth's, they are similar in that they are both gifted and they both have suffered traumatic things in their lives (we don't know much about what led the mother to do what she did so we can only speculate. The show doesn't say it was necessarily due to her 'genius', could have been other circumstances, her personality, etc.) But while her mother gave in to despair, Beth overcame her struggles, was able to form healthy bonds who became her support system, and overcame her addiction, while still being able to maintain her gift and accomplish her goals, showing that you can be a genius and also lead a healthy, fulfilling life.",

I am a strong believe that every skill is learnable. maybe someone can perform something quicker, but at very least I can learn to do that slower. Einstein and Edison, I guess, are considered \"geniuses\" but both struggled at school.  \n\n\nMy point is that they surely practised and were curious to learn new things that lead to success. I oppose theory that they could live all their life \"under the rock\" and then, out of nowhere, wright the theory of relativity. I agree, they are comfortable with numbers but is it because the galaxy \"shared\" something unique with them that did not share with anyone else? I dont think so, but how can I know? :)  \n\n\n\\- Yes, I have read the essay. The author referenced a lot of things, but I did not understood what is her point. She described in details her complaint about society perceiving women in a certain way and associating some professions with women, and what now? Having a \"compliant\" stance, also referred as a \"victim\" doesn't help, unless you are just looking for attention. I am pretty sure all of us can consider our current options and choose whats best. I am talking from my own experience so maybe it only worked \"in my world\". I am curious to know your opinion or where I am narrow-minded.",

                "comment_text": ">\"genius\" means very intelligent, no relation too \"gifted\"\n\nThat's a very very narrow definition. You can be a musical genius, that has no corellation with intelligence. When someone is seemingly effortlessly good at something, they are commonly refered to as \"something\" genius. (Btw. as far as I know, Einstein having trouble at school is a myth. He had a lot of sixes in his school report which would be the worst mark in germany, where a 6 corresponds to an F and a 1 to an A. But he went to a swiss school, where it's reversed and a 6 is an A and a 1 would be an F. So he did actually very good in school, but that misconception lead to that myth)\n\nOf course a genius still has to learn and study. They aren't born with some \"pre-programmed\" knowledge, but they have a much much easier time understanding, remembering and applying what they have learned.\n\nBeth studied chess hard. Beltik might have studied even harder than her, but her \"genius\" helped her get past Beltik with a lot less effort. And it helped her get beyond anything Beltik could ever hope to reach, even if he would dedicate his whole life to nothing but learning chess. And he knows that. That's why he stopped.\n\nLet's back up a little. You asked, why Alma was made to be a pianist. My argument was, that she does not have that much of a personality in the book (it's been a while since I read it. Correct me if I'm wrong), so they added something, that wasn't in the book, without contradicting the book and that fit into the time of the story. One of the essays point (imho) is, that the role of the woman was that of a housewife. It was unusual for them to have jobs and socially accepted hobbies were mainly artistic, like painting or music. In that way, the essay strengthens the shows decision to give Alma that hobby. And they used it to parallel Beth.\n\nAlma is very good. Had the chance to go professional, but was to scared. And now she lives her life (maybe unconciously?) regretting that decision. So when she sees Beths chance to \"go professional\", a part of why Alma helps Beth might stem from making up for that regret.\n\n\\--\n\nWhen you translate something from one medium to another, there are bound to be changes. In books, you often have \"internal monologues\", that would be strange in a movie (see Lynchs \"Dune\" for example). And that's just one aspekt. It takes hours to read a book, but in a movie, you usually have about two.\n\nSo there always wil be changes. The question is, how good or bad are those changes.\n\nIf you leave stuff out, it can be good, because it drags in the book, but it's usually bad, because it gives context. And if you add stuff, it can be bad, because it contradicts stuff in the book, but it can also be good, because it enhances the story, giving it more depth. You can change things to fix plot holes or make it work better in the new medium, or you can mess up and destroy what made the original source great.\n\nAdding Alma being a pianist is good or at least not bad imho. Changing the events in paris is bad (again imho). Adding Beths mother being a math genius (gone crazy/suicidal) is more on the bad chlich\u00e9 side for me. Adding/changing the line about the female russian chessmaster was probably the most stupidly unnecessary thing they did. Combining several people into the twins or Townes helped the show and the viewers. I'm relatively indifferent about Beth knowing russian in the show; I prefer the book. The scene in the orphanage *might* have been excusable by 1983 standards as \"exploring sexuality\" (which Beth later continues to do. On *her* terms), but as I already wrote, it was probably the best decision they made to leave it out in the show completely.\n\nSo the question with changes is always, how much do they really impact the story. And with The Queen's Gambit, the faithfullness by far outweighs all of the (rather minor) changes they did.",

However, another interpretation of mine that is more likely to be wrong is that he did not want to play with her at all (at least during the first few games of the book), so he decided to keep the advantage. Only after she was able to defeat him did he allow her to play white. As a chess player, it's important to practice playing both sides, but perhaps an important part of her training was to be playing with black, as most chess players play worse with black. He probably wanted her to get better with black and then move onto white, which is easier. Most chess players will allow their opponent to pick a pawn from a hand and they'll play the color that the pawn is (as the show displays), so it was interesting that Mr. Shaibel didn't do that.",

I'd have to re-read that, but it was probably a combination of the right time in her life and circumstances (at a party with alcohol and other drugs involved) and her curiosity.\n\nSome normal girls are picky, but by far not all. Also, we (and Beth) only know he's a \"loser\", *after* his performance.\n\nBeth is shown having trouble with social interactions. And with nothing to compare, that's just another \"that's it?\" situation for her.\n\nThe show makes it even more clear. Beth is \"interested\" in the subject ever since Jolene told her about the \"special thumb\". She was watching the boys outside the orphanage both fascinated and also frightened. She watched the two making out in the library and was quickly enamoured by Townes. But she also has a lot of trouble connecting. The twins were nice, but more like friends. And Benny was just out of the question. So was Beltik.\n\nIn the book, there aren't that many males in her age range. Towns and the twins do not really exist there. They are amalgamations of several one-note characters that were only in Beths life for one scene at a time, most of them without even a name.\n\nSo we don't really see other potential firsts. We can assume she never sought out anyone else. And probably noone else was really interested in her. In the book, she is described to *not* look like ATJ, mind you. So the russian study partner probably was just the first time things aligned.",

The phrases \"losing her virginity\" and \"giving her virginity\" make it seem like the woman is just passive and has something to \"lose\". \n\nI think Beth just wanted to experience sex and didn't place so much value or importance on the concept of virginity. Sex was just another thing to try, the opportunity arose, and she decided to give it a go.\n\nDuring the whole series we see that her attitude to sex is nonchalant. Almost like it's another disposable pleasure like smoking, drinking, or drugs. She clearly doesn't put much emotional attachment on the act and casually parkates when she decides she wants to. With Beltik it felt like she slept with him just because he was there. Same with Benny. They offered and she decided \"OK\" but she wasn't pining after any of them and she certainly didn't get emotionally attached which was refreshing because I'm so sick of female characters becoming messed up and clingy after sex because they confuse it with love blah blah blah.\n\nSo I think it showed sex and concepts of virginity are not as important to her as chess is. It didn't come off as \"not like other girls\" to me because we literally already knew Beth wasn't like other girls so it's not to show her as being superior, but I would say it was to show her differing priorities from \"other girls\".",

No the show is not about Beth being a Chess Genius from taking \"Horse Tranquilizers\" (They are just normal Tranquilizers) How did you get the horse thing? Anyways, Beth is very gifted even without them. If you didn't know, chess can become quite stressful to some people which causes them to throw their game. The Tranquilizers are used by Beth to calm herself down and find ways to visualize and counter attack (She sees the board on the roof to analyze how her attack patterns go and how each attack would result ultimately determining the best option) and it's not an instant way to win it's just a way to either equalize a match or retaliate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB. She uses them because she can't calm down and stresses out, however, in the game with Borgov she instead learns how to calm herself down and visualize on her own (Scraping the subject of her using said pills)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC. Have you even watched the episodes? She is shown to cream a lot of students at a young age without taking the tranquilizers, she is just heavily addicted in it. Even at the US championship match she creamed a lot of professional players in low move counts. Also the only time she uses it on matches are when she faces Beltik and Borgov (It's been a year since I last watched it so I could be wrong here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm glad to answer all the other questions but the point of the film is to show not every famous person has a good life, has a rough childhood, not everything is picture perfect, and shows how she becomes heavily reliant on it to throwing them away completely.",

The book it's based on doesn't really get into her parents. But it's clear that she is a chess prodigy. A \"genius\" even. Very likely on the spectrum, though. \n\nSo she likely has an (over)active mind. She also get's nervous a lot. In the first big game against Beltik, she's kind of a mess and then get's her first period, too. A billion things running through her mind and then the pills help her calm down, tone out everything else and thus focus on the game. \n\nSimilar thing with alcohol. It dulls the brain and let's you forget about all the worries that weigh you down. For a little while at least (before it usually comes all crashing down even harder). \n\nSo no. The show is not about a girl becoming a chess genius ***from*** eating tranquilizers. The show is about a (chess) genius that got used to the idea that drugs were the only way to tap into that potential (by letting her forget for a time about all the hardship in her life) and then finally getting to the realization that she can do it without them. Doing even better without them.",

That's part of the reason for its huge popularity in the USSR. It's simple and cheap enough for everybody to play.\n\nThere is some literary devicing going on here too. Had Beth had a chess set, the reader/viewer would have had less of a reason to see that she was so gifted that she could play through whole games in her imagination.\n\nTo try stop answering your question the way I want and start answering it the way you want, however: you could look for scans of ads during that time period, or photos of intact old chess sets with the original price printed on the box.  I tried briefly to do this, but it turns out chess was a popular visual/metaphor in old liquor, cigarette, insurance, etc. ads, so you'd have to do some digging.",

In the book, as in the series, Beltik teaches her to study and not just wing it with her considerable gifts, and Benny does a more formidable version of the same thing. Beth counters Beltik with the straw-man argument that she doesn't need to be more like players who just \"memorize everything\", but eventually she realizes that Beltik and Benny are right that she can't rely on intuition alone.\n\nI think the point of both is the same, that Beth has a natural gift but lacks discipline, which is part (not all, of course) of how she lapses into addiction. Her gift is all her own, but she needs to connect with other people, listen to them and learn from them to reach her full potential.",

I'm rewatching at the moment and the camera work and sound design is absolutely beautiful, I love the use of the chess clocks especially. The music just encapsulates the mood of the situation so well, it's incredible, especially for a soundtrack that is mostly just piano and strings. \n\nEven just on this rewatch I realised several things I didn't notice before, like when at the Menthuan home, a film is shown about manners and the particular scene that we are sown is shown is about introducing people. Later in Cincinatti, Beth has to be reminded by her mother to introduce Matt and Mike which I thought was an interesting nod back to episode one. Also how when Beth talks during Beltik's game he says \"Do you mind\" and Beth says it simarly when her mother has the TV on quite loud while Beth is preparing.   \n\n\nThis is basically the perfect show for me, it's a historical drama about chess and it's so well executed and written.... I just wanted to express some love for the show. Wouldn't change a thing",

She and Judit are very similar in terms of playing style but I don't see much similarity in their lives other than being women playing top level chess. \n\nBobby Fischer is such an odd figure I don't know where to start. He was incredibly smart in terms of chess and other puzzles but very easily swayed by all sorts of propaganda. He was a member of a cult like religious group for a long time who he gave a lot of money to. He was also anti-semantic (to the point of basically being a Nazi) (one incident where he gave a Jewish opponent a copy of Mein Kampf might have to fact check me on that though!). I don't see Beth as very similar to him either other than being a prodigy, which a lot of chess world champions are (you might be able to argue that Botvinnik wasn't a prodigy as he started playing chess at the age of 14). Fischer's childhood was sad but for different reasons than Beth, I think his family was really poor so they couldn't afford to eat much. \n\nI think I see Beth as a more Alekhine like figure. Alekhine did struggle with addiction for much of his life and ended up dying from alchohol poisoning I believe. I think I'd put her at Paul Morphy and Alexander Alekhine, maybe a bit of Kasparov?",

I find it very hard to believe that she just forgot about it. Neither the show nor the book (I think) explains her point of view, it is just mentioned that she didn't pay him back, and I've never found that convincing. What is your take on this?",

Maybe she thought she would pay him back when she got more money then truly forgot. Until he died. Then it popped in her head. And maybe the guilt of not paying him back played a part in her specifically mentioning him in all her interviews. She wanted recognition for him because if it was for his teaching and paying for her first tournament she wouldn\u2019t be where she was.",

This would not have happened if she didn't care enough to find Beth.\n\nAnyway - Beth DID go back to the orphange and discovered the bulletin board.

I absolutely love the series.\nI have read the book once but I was very ill back then and details are muddy...\nBut there's a lot of difference between them.\nI am still a big fan of both of them...\nI was wondering if anyone over here has read the book too?\n\nBook is quite different if I remember correctly... \nThere's actually a pretty decent bookstore around the grocery shop... \nthe orphanage is completely different, Beth's mother is not mentioned at all - which played a crucial part in the series...\nBeth is brunette and not described as eccentric and pretty...\nAnd the most shocking thing was (still muddy on this one) there was no call from america to Russia before her final game in the book with benny and all the other people and lexinton reporter (forgot his name, bad with names) ... In the end she was all alone that night before final endgame. (as far as i remember, i was very ill when i read the book, correct me if i am wrong). I was quite shocked because the phone call and everything played a huge role in the series finale.\n\nTo me both book and series are quite wonderful in their own way... But at same time they are a lot different at many crucial points.\n\nThe most favorite part of both is when she is able to visualize the chess board in the end game without the help of any pills or alcohol or anything.\nOther scenes like jolene showing up, Mr. Shaibel funeral, her telling off to alma's husband and that hotel manager, and well i love the whole series....\nI especially love the musical score.",

Most dialog and scenes were 1:1. But maybe it's the plethora of bad adaptations that skew my view. \n\nThe one major change from book to show that I did not like at all was Cleo in Paris. Because it completely changes the second encounter with Borgov and I think the way it happened in the book had so much more impact on Beth. In the show, she's drunk/hung over and loses. If only she was sober, she might have had a chance... No! In the book she *was* sober and prepared and on top of her game and *still* lost. No excuses. Borgov wiped the floor with her. It was devastating and led to her escapades afterwards. If it was \"only because she was drunk/hung over\" as the show suggests, why would she be so afraid of Borgov? \n\nAnd it also led to unnecessary speculations of Cleo being a KGB plant (as did other additions to that end). Now with the current situation in the world it suddenly became a very delicate topic, but I still think it was a bold move for the book written in 1983, the height of the cold war, to specifically *not* paint the russians as the token bad guys. \n\nSo purely storywise, I prefer the book. But since again, I think the show is very faithful for the most part, it's not by a lot. And with the gorgeous cinematography, incredible score and phenomenal acting all around and especially by ATJ, I like to experience the story via the show now more. And even when reading the book, I can't shake having the \"theatre of the mind\" feeling a lot like the show now. Not that I'd even want to shake it.",

                "comment_text": "Among the changes of the TV series from the book, I thought the biggest change was Beth's father. Like Beth's mother, the book provides only a bare sketch of \"Daddy\". But in the book, Beth's mom and dad are not separated. Also, he's not alive like the man Beth only sees through windows in the TV series. Rather, in the book, Beth's dad was a \"carefree\" drunk who was away from home a lot (no explanation why, maybe his job?), but who did come home. Beth's mom and died argued a lot late at night, which is why Beth has trouble sleeping and is anxious from even calm quiet talking in the hallway late at night. Beth's book dad died the year before her mom died, which answers why Beth went to Methuen instead of going to live with her father. In contrast, why Beth doesn't go live with her TV father, even if they were estranged, is a mystery question.\n\nThe most impactful aspect of Beth's book father is that whenever he was home, he'd always do small repairs around the house and she'd accompany him as his little helper. Beth was \"never happier\" than when \"Daddy\" praised her for her help. This was part of the tranquilizer pill heist scene, built around her prior experience using a screwdriver. The fact that Beth was \"never happier\" than when praised by her book dad is significant background given the formative praise from Schaibel and Ganz at the start of her chess odyssey and affirmation from Luchenko and Borgov at the end of her character arc.",

He quits chess because he realizes that its not for him, he\u2019s not interested/passionate in it as much as he used to or so he thought.

(The bed scene was paralleled with how Beth and Benny scene too) I think Harry had an idealized version of Beth in his head, I don\u2019t think its wanting to dominate her he already knows that she\u2019s way better than him. We don\u2019t know how long Harry stays with her i think the book might\u2019ve said weeks, the show seems to imply its more than two weeks either he stayed that long or left a bit early and Beth was just alone before the Ohio match",

I love how Townes is the character they choose to be there in person with her, to reconcile the relationship arc and use it to spur her on towards sobriety and \"fulfilling her potential\" so to speak. I love how he becomes a conduit for all her friends to call in and support her. I love how much of a positive impact this match and his words have on her, and the mutual appreciation they are both able to share for each other. I honestly think about it all the time. It's what I feel like I need as well in life (who doesn't), when battling my own demons and finding the support and resolve to follow through. Just an absolutely stunning, deeply effecting and impactful scene",

I\u2019m glad that this show has inspired the younger generations to play. Also props to A T J for a riveting performance, deserving of all the accolades received.

I still didn\u2019t have interest in playing, but I appreciated it more, and hyper-related to Beth. I remembered how much I liked it earlier this year and felt compelled to rewatch it, and related to Beth even more. Then I got my parents to watch it, and my mom was like \u201cYou need to learn chess\u201d. So then I went to this chess club at a childhood favorite restaurant, and learned and proceeded to play for like over 2 hours. It\u2019s not every week, but I went for my second time last nigh and played for almost 3 hours. Everyone seems to be surprised by how good I am after just 2 weeks, and I won my first game last night!",

We both decided we'd participate.\n\nWe went to the activity room that morning and to our surprise there was no one there.  In fact, the person in charge knew nothing about it.  I showed him the itinerary and he said again said he was not told.\n\nWe waited about 15 minutes and no one else showed up.  My son and I decided to play each other.

The QG really struck a chord with me and during the pandemic I felt like I should try to start playing again and recently I've gotten somewhat competitive, and I've played in my first over the board tournaments in the past two years or so.\n\nChess has been a casual joy of mine for my entire life, and I've been either very bad or quite good at different pivotal moments in my life. No stories, other than that it has been a constant thing for me in one way or another, and I feel like my playing style has shifted along with the stages I have been in in my life when I find myself playing it.",

But one I keep coming back to is the scene where adult Beth goes to the store where she stole the chess magazine as a child. She takes the same magazine off the rack and brings it to the counter where the same grumpy clerk who wouldn't let her read it in the store is still working. He barely looks at her and says \"Don't you want to steal this one too?\" And in my head canon, I am imagining that he let her get away with it because he understood what it was like to want something  you can't afford. He shows a glimpse of that softer side when he asks her if she's going to the championship mentioned on the cover. He's been following her career all along. Such a tiny moment, but beautiful.",

Her low points are punctuated by someone telling her \"Give 'em hell, kid\" and it keeps her going (Alma, then Beltik, then Benny, then Jolene).",

And I read a lot about Tal, Fischer, Spassky, Petrosian, Larsen, etc. \n\nAnd I used to study those wonderful games from a hundred years ago: Morphy, Capablanca, Dr Steinitz, Adolf Anderson, etc. \n\nWatching **The Queen's Gambit** brought back all those memories. I also loved the new take take on things. Instead of Fischer vs. Spassky, we had a female protagonist.\n\nGreat show! Really enjoyed it. \n\nPS. I'm as rusty as hell but I headed over to [chess.com](https://chess.com) and tried my luck. I was checkmated in 4.6 moves. Oh well!",

I really like Botvinnik openings like the French or the Sicilian or the Queen's gambit so it really helps me to study his games. \n\nI haven't looked at as many Fischer games as I perhapes should, I'll have a look at game 6, thanks for the info!",

(and mostly as a drug case study - also illegal)\nAs you can see later Alma (Adopted mother) takes them on a prescription.\nBut Beth got addicted to them in the shortest period of time they were given to her in orphanage as you can see the effect in series itself that she even touched a radiator and burned her hand and didn't feel anything right after she took the first Vitamins - Green Pill (Tranquilizers) and jolene mentions she especially told her to take them at bed time because everything feel off as soon you take them (Meal scene).\n\nBefore on very first day before vitamins beth couldn't sleep and was constantly getting flashbacks of her mother and father. (in books its different , she hates nights, is extremely anxious and can't sleep at all and can hear every conversation people are having in other room,that stop after she stops using pills and plays chess to distract which becomes a love and a passion a downright coping mechanism and she is savage at it and she loves winning and the control in a place where she has no control)\nAfter the Vitamins... She was able to visualize a chess board because she saw Mr. Shailbel play and she wanted to escape and taking Tranquilizers at night time helped her  clear her mind.\nBasically , Tranquilizers are psychotics. At that time they were called Tranquilizers because the medicine was very new. And there weren't many. Like this and that different ones for anxiety, depression, or ptsd or such. There was simple tranquility medicine in layman term.\nWhich beth was suffering from, anxiety, depression and ptsd. You can see it throughout the series. When orphanage stopped the magic vitamins so to say she had serious withdrawal as was sick and even on day of high school tournament of simultaneous that's why jolene got her those pills. (Other kids at orphanage had withdrawls too)\n(its mentioned in details in books)\n\nBeth never really hallucinated. Hallucinations are completely different. She was just visualizing. With a clear head with meds which she must have been on considering her mental state.\n\nWhen she was in mexico and lost Alma, she asked for prescription meds. Which required no prescription in mexico area so she jumped the gun and bought a lot. She basically escaped more and more and more into substance after she lost Alma. To downright dangerougs.\nEspecially after France and Jerk Husband conned her for the house. She looses Benny too. And basically a domino effect untill jolene comes into picture.\n\nWe get this hint again and again ... Like in new york when beth hasn't touched pills or alcohol n beats benny and 2 other grandmasters at speed chess. Multiple times. (in series).\n\nShe wasn't on Tranquilizers from age 9 to 13 (fake age) still played in her head (visualized) the modern chess opening book that jolene stole when beth got adopted.\nIt was very much by chamce that Alma was on Tranquilizers too. And she used tranquilizers in Kentucky final tournament game. She didn't in any else. (i think)\n\nIn russia, even before russia...  Ever since she met jolene.... It was months.... She didn't touch the pills or alcohol. In any game , and in final match with borgov u can see she visualizes the board without it.\n(book and series, in book ... She was completely alone, no townes reporter guy in russia)\n\nSo, Chess board wasn't really a hallucation.\n\nAnd tranquilizers weren't enhancers in anyway. In present time they will be anti anxiety, anti depression and such. Basically mental illness meds.",

The series is set in the 60's when doctors were writing prescriptions like these tranquilizers to anyone and everyone just to get them out of the door - Unhappy or depressed house wives like Alma were big victims of this malpractice practice as the drugs could even be prescribed through a husband's request with no consultation on the wife's behalf needed. This was basically the same thing that the orphanage did to the children. Feed them pills to keep them docile and give a false sense of feeling content As we see (much like most people who were prescribed the drug incorrectly) Alma's reaction to the drug is aloofnes, complacency, and introversion. I know she also had a drinking problem, which, of course, was a contributor as well. \n\n Minds altering drugs are prescribed to correct a chemical imbalance in the brain. Alma should have never been prescribed because they were not compatible. However, with Harmon, we see how the drug is supposed to work with someone who is quite the perfect candidate.",

I\u2019m pretty sure he talked about the point you raised, though he didn\u2019t cite specific songs. Personally, I thought he did an amazing job. He even went against the director\u2019s recommendation of keeping the score only piano.  I watched the series again after hearing that and tried to see what it would have been like with only piano music. It\u2019s impossible to do that, though.  The music that I\u2019ve come to associate with certain scenes or moods include strings, etc. I can\u2019t go back.  \ud83d\ude0a",

Yes, she introduced Beth to alcohol. There is little to excuse that. But on all other accounts, she was the mother Beth needed. One she could confide in, one to set her straight when she needs it (I *love* the \"now you do (know what it's like to lose), too\") but also one to let her make her own experiences, trusting her enough to not do anything stupid.",

My favorite scenes with Alma are when she\u2019s holding Beth\u2019s $100 check from winning the Kentucky state championship and amazingly says, \u201cand you won this!?!?\u201d, and the scene in the airplane where she\u2019s reading a magazine article about Beth and says, \u201cthis is national recognition dear\u201d, and the birthday scene where Alma gives Beth the Bulova wristwatch, \u201cit\u2019s a Bulova\u201d. \ud83d\ude02 The only thing I would want to change about Alma\u2019s character would be to allow her to live longer.

If it had failed Beth would have been shipped back to Methuen and Alma would have had to crawl to Denver.  Besides that she didn't preach or yell and she was patient. Not bad for an amateur.\n\nThe sequence that clinches it for me was the aftermath of the US Open where she lost to Benny.  Beth got snippy with Alma and Alma bit her tongue. Later in the cab Beth reached out and put her hand in Alma's, asking in essence for comfort and got it.  Latter on she wore Alma's house coat for comfort so all in all I'm a proud member of Team Alma. YMMV.",

He didn't seem to want to get rid of Beth in the flashbacks we see, he just told Alice to come back later because he didn't want to discuss in front of his family \n\nAnd even if he refused to care for her, didn't he and Alice come from wealthy families?

No good person would leave their child with a severely unstable and dangerous parental figure when they have the financial means to help that child. I think it boils down to the classic absentee father figure who seems to want a family, but just not you. It\u2019s used to give Beth a stronger bond with Mr. Shaibel, as he\u2019s her only real father figure throughout the film, and explain her personality, trauma and addiction more. Sooo I guess my answer is, plot, and he\u2019s an asshole.",

The photograph, taken on the porch of the gray house on Maplewood Drive, showed Beth in a simple cotton frock. Even then, she was clearly plain. A legend under the picture read: \"Orphaned by yesterday's pile-up on New Circle Road, Elizabeth Harmon surveys a troubled future. Elizabeth, eight, was left without family by the crash, which killed two and injured others. At home alone at the time, Elizabeth learned of the accident shortly before the photo was taken. She will be well looked after, authorities say.\"\n\n... and that's pretty much it. When Jolene asks her about her parents it says:\n\nThe words \"mother\" and \"dead\" were unbearable. She wanted to run, but there was no place to run to.   \n\"Your folks,\" Jolene said in a voice that was not unsympathetic, \"they dead?\"  \nBeth could find nothing to say or do. She stood in line terrified, waiting for the pills.\n\nAnd the other thing the reader learns about the mother:\n\nMother had said \"Damn\" all the time. \n\nAll from the first two pages. I remember there being a similar half-sentence for the father somewhere, But that's all we get about her family. Beth is obviously shocked, but also immediately put on pills. And while of course influencing her whole life, the parents are never directly mentioned again (as far as I remember).",

So, I'm curious, how much does the book resemble the show, and is it interesting to read? \nI'd say I have a pretty basic taste in books and movies (I usually like things everyone likes tbh), so what would you say, would the book appeal to a general audience like the TV show does?",

The narrative feels a bit cold, so I actually felt that I was reading a script, not a book. Maybe that was my mistake because I read it after watching the show, but honestly, I was expecting more about the book. \nAbout the scenes, as I've sed before, the show is really loyal todo the book, so there is only one scene that is not in the serie, and believe me, is better this way. \nThe book may be good for you if you are kind of into external narrators, but for me, it was a disappointment.",

Why is she and the black girl so resentful towards the place that took them in free of charge, fed/clothed and gave her a warm bed, allowed her to learn chess (although it was against \"the rules\") and then placed her in a great middle income home with a woman she loved.  And then on top of this she and the black girl giggle and metophorically roll their eyes at funeral goes for the old man who taught her chess.  I get that she finally goes back in and ends up getting emotional but what is with all the resentment and talk about throwing rocks through the windows and shitting on the headmistress woman who fell and broke her hip (hilarious right?....um what?).  That place was nothing but a good thing for a young girl put in a shit situation by a shit mother.  Same for the black girl.  Makes them both look spoiled and ungrateful.  No?",

                "comment_text": "Great questions! Let's consider them one at a time.\n\nFirst, why are Beth and Jolene resentful towards Methuen?\n\nConsider an extreme comparison. If I grow up in an verbally abusive household, I might never want to go back there again. This can be true even if the household provided me with clothing, shelter, opportunities, food, etc. The household was a mixed experience, and the negative parts of it make it so that I don't want to return.\n\nI think this is how we should think about how Beth experiences returning to Methuen. You're totally right that it's a place that gave her opportunities/resources she would not have had otherwise. That's the positive part of her experience there. But it's also a place that got her addicted to pills, and that punished her when she was a small child for trying to get more pills by taking away chess and Mr. Shaibel's friendship -- even though they're the reason she was addicted in the first place! This is the negative part of her experience. It can be the case that she does not want to go in there again because of the negative part, even if the positive part is true. (I think the same points are true for Jolene, but we have less details about her life at Methuen to really back it up).\n\nYou might argue that she should be more grateful and appreciative about the positive parts, and less bitter about the negative parts. That might be right, but she's also not thinking clearly or emotionally balanced at that time. She's recently been on an alcohol binge and recently found out that Mr. Shaibel died. I think it's understandable that she's upset, and viewing things particualrly negatively at that time.\n\nSecond, why do Beth and Jolene giggle at Mr. Shaibel's funeral?\n\nI think we view the scene differently. Beth tells Jolene that she owed Mr. Shaibel $10. Jolene then giggles, and Beth gives her a look (look at 11:05 during the 7th episode). The look she gives Jolene does not, I think, suggest Beth is similarly jocular. I think the look communicates that Jolene should stop laughing. This suggests that Beth was not giggling.\n\nAs for why Jolene is laughing, I think this one is harder. One possible answer is that there is a dark humor here. Beth says that she feels bad. This makes sense given that she's at a funeral. But then Beth says that she feels bad because she owed him $10. This is kind of subversion of expectation, which is a popular mechanism for jokes. Instead of feeling bad about his death, she feels bad about owing him $10. That's like worrying about a scratch on my car when I'm on the way to the hospital because of my broken ribs. There's a kind of absurdity.\n\nAnother possible answer is that she's dealing with her grief by laughing. This is a common resopnse to grief. I find this answer less compelling though given that Jolene and Mr. Shaibel didn't seem that close.\n\nThird, why do they joke about Mrs. Deardorff breaking her hip?\n\nWe again don't see the scene the same way. Beth notes that Deardorff isn't there, and then Jolene informs her that Deardorff fell and broke her hip (10:28 of the  same episode). Eventually Jolene says that this almost made her believe in God. I don't think Beth is joking about Deardorff's broken hip -- it seems like Jolene was just informing Beth, and that Beth was taking in the information. So I don't think Beth is joking about it.\n\nAs for Jolene, I think Mrs. Deardorff represents the disciplinarian authority that Jolene experienced while at Methuen. This makes sense since Deardorff was the head of the home. And we know that Jolene had problems with authority while at the home (getting her mouthed washed with soap for calling everyone a cocksucker, and also her current ambitions to be a radical that changes the existent authority structures of the US). I think that Jolene is jokingly taking Deardorff's injury as a just response to the unjust disciplinarian authority she experienced at Methuen. We don't see enough of Jolene's experience at Methuen to give concrete examples, but I think this is a fair understanding of Jolene's response.",

They didn't want to share a room with 30+ other girls, follow strict rules, follow a religion that maybe neither of them identified with, they constantly had to appeal to potential adopters by pretending they were happy there, lying about their age, etc. Also it wasn't shown too much in the show but the woman who fell and broke her hip was supposed to be very cold and overbearing. They didn't have a wonderful childhood to look back on so they weren't going to see the orphanage as a sanctuary or a blessing. It would have been strange if they went back to visit and were like \"aww remember how great this place was after our parents died and they forced us to wear one outfit for the next 10+ years?\"",

Why the change?\n\nMight have something to do with the decision to move the matches to the evening (more cinematic?) but they wanted to keep the scene where she hops out of the car. Also, the Agent character is given a much larger role in the show than the book, so maybe this was to give him a few extra lines. I know some think the filmmakers are implying she might stay in Moscow for a bit, but I don't believe that for a moment, not with the fact that she still has to pay back Jolene for the tickets.\n\nI think it's simpler than that. They wanted to end on that amazing scene of her walking in the White Queen outfit, though the park to play the old man. When you have an actress that luminous, you go for the beauty shot.

My guess is that she represents what Beth was \u201cmissing out on\u201d when she left that party in school. Which is the simple, unsatisfactory life of a typical housewife in that time. The \u201cpopular\u201dpeaked in high-school type. Those girls singing to that song Beth didn\u2019t know, talking about things Beth wasn\u2019t interested in... she wasn\u2019t them. The bottles reminded Beth of Alma in many ways, a life she wasn\u2019t living, but one she was all too familiar with. I think the fact that Beth sees the alcohol and has struggled with it, yet seems SO radically different from Margaret, shows how addiction and vice follows troubled people of all kinds. Beths addiction stemmed from her childhood trauma and the benzos that she was put on without knowledge of what they were at the orphanage. By the time she meets Margaret she\u2019s been there and done that and her life is in a very different spot. Beths addiction seems like a life long battle, something she was almost born into. Where Margaret\u2019s seems like an inevitable consequence of her life choices and upbringing. I think of the scene where Beth is speaking with Mr. Wheatley in Almas robe after her passing. Specifically when she says Alma was stuck. I think Beth views, and we are meant to view, Margret in a very similar light. Stuck. I also found out the store they meet in Ben Snyder\u2019s, the department store she insulted Beth for being at earlier in the show.  The whole scene is meant to juxtapose the two characters and show how different Beth really is. How a good upbringing doesn\u2019t lead to success but can pigeonhole you into a plain and sad life if you don\u2019t utilize it.",

Then in the final episode, Townes believes the Russian embassy fast tracked his visa, hoping he would distract Beth.\n\nI can\u2019t think of anyway the KGB could have gotten this information. During their first match, Beth wouldn\u2019t have been on their radar. Nothing observable happened at the US open. He took a photograph of her, but a lot of people did, how could they draw any conclusion from that.\n\nUnless, Cleo informed someone about Beth and Townes?",

(Reference last scene when he apologizes and she asks \u201cwhat for?\u201d thinking he is talking about his shameful secret (60s) and he only mentions her chess loss). \n\nHe tricked her emotionally, while Benny tricked her intellectually. (KGB hope to kill her fighting spirit then and there, thus eliminating the mirroring/dual shameful threat, i.e., her being a girl).\n\nIf Roger truly was KGB and this theory was true, he would have had a dual mission: 1. Make Townes \u201chappy\u201d in that way, but also 2. Make sure he is discovered to devastate Beth in learning a shameful truth about her first sexual interest. (One could argue that her first love was Chess and her first male love was Mr. Schibel, so the sexual element matters here). So her seeing him would sabotage her chess play and keep Townes around/interested in something additional long enough to be the true pawn in the \u201csabotaging\u201d itself. He liked Beth in a way he hadn\u2019t felt before and was, as he said himself, \u201ca bit confused.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Townes also could have made that comment because he was involved in tournaments before Beth and likely was aware of Soviet sabotage efforts. But that\u2019s less interesting than this theory ahaha",

Beth is clearly the better player in every situation but Beltik understands the importance of studying one's opponent and understanding their style to have the best chance at victory.\n\nI'm writing a paper and this section will probably be a little shorter based on its minor significance but I still feel like there is something important to be said about it. What is the nature of Beth and Beltik's relationship? Is there something more beneath the surface? \n\n\\*If you reply it would be very helpful if you indicate whether you're talking about the book, show, or both (maybe with a B, S, or Bo indicator idk) (but this isn't necessary)\n\n\\*\\*For those following my series of posts the paper is coming along well, all your responses have given me new found motivation to keep going on it!

The literal, metaphorical, and narrative cohesion between the scene is one of the best written sections I've ever read in a novel. \n\nBut what about Beth vs Borgov (Round 1) in that same tournament? I'm looking for better ways to talk about Borgov and how he is the antithesis to Beth as a character. What are your thoughts on Borgov and everything he represents? How would you talk about him in relation to Beth? \n\nAny additional insight into his chess style, appearance, metaphorical representation, etc would be much appreciated (especially if it is compared to Beth and how they differ/are similar.",

Back then that version of the Sicilian was rarer to see, whereas in the 2018 World Chess Championship between Carlsen and Caruana, it was featured nearly every other game. So he got her out of preparation and played super solid.\n\nHe bet that she'd panic, overextend, and make a mistake -- which is exactly what happened. It's the Carlsen approach (even though Borgov is much weaker than Carlsen, the style of play is similar) where rather than taking risks, you wait till your opponent makes a mistake and then capitalize. Experience versus ingenuity. \n\nYou can contrast this with the final game, where Borgov tried to play the risky Albin Counter-Gambit and Beth refused and instead steered the game into a positional QGD, showing she was ready to face him in his own style.",

It's so enormous that no living player knows everything there is to know about it (although top players can handle themselves well in most lines). \n\nTake, for example, this years' world championship, Carlsen vs Nepomniatchchi. With White, Nepo went for the Ruy each time against Carlsen. He was obviously preparing something wild and crazy, but in response Carlsen attempted to play the incredibly sharp Marshall variation -- look it up if you don't know what I mean -- which at the highest level is essentially so dangerous for White to enter that Nepo couldn't risk challenging Carlsen there. It would be too difficult. So he was reluctantly forced to play quiet, \"anti-Marshall\" lines, and play slow positional chess -- which of course is EXACTLY what Carlsen wanted. \n\nIn the book, if I remember the scene correctly, a similar scenario happens: Beth stays away from the sharpest lines, fearing what Borgov can do, which of course hands him the exact type of game he wants to play and takes her totally out of her comfort zone. \n\nIt's a lesson in how being risk-adverse is often riskier than staying true to who you are.",

I think the whole show suffers heavily from a lack of understanding the book\u2019s subtext. \n\nWhen I start rewatching the show I\u2019m going to try to approach it from two perspectives: \n1) The show being an adaptation and trying to carry over the book\u2019s themes to film\nAnd..\n2) The show tries to show new themes instead of adapting the old ones\n\nI already know how far it falls from perspective #1 so I really hope that #2 will show a better side that I missed but rewatching this scene does not give me much hope.",

The only character that could pass for kind of having a southern accent is Jolene. But it doesn\u2019t make sense why every other character does not.\n\nI understand that a lot of the actors are British and I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for them to perfect their American accents. However I think the show would have felt more realistic if they actually sounded like they were from Kentucky or if the show was based in a northern state.",

She comes off as more confident and dominant cause we don\u2019t really know whats in her mind but Beth is very insecure of herself, from how she looks physically to her chess skills.

When his wife says \"he's been held indefinitely\" I thought it was code for \"he died\", especially considering she says she has no husband anymore. Then he just answers the phone when Beth calls him. Why did he leave and why couldn't his wife care less?!<\n\n>!2) It seems odd to me that nothing happens after Beth's game against Bergov in Paris. She shows up late and drunk, she loses the game in the most shameful way possible and then she's just received as a world star in Moscow a few months later. I thought there would be some heavy public shaming against her behavior, imagine what would happen today to a world-class athlete who shows up drunk at the final match of a world-class competition. Isn't that weird?!<",

This was not a period in history where divorce was considered an option. Allston may as well have been dead to Alma, gone and never coming back.\n\n2.) There was no outside proof that Beth was drunk at that game. We know because we saw it, but the people at the match may have just thought she was nervous and intimidated. She lost a chess match to the world champion, which is really not that bad a loss in the scheme of things. It feels like the end of the world to Beth, because of how much she hates to lose. More likely, she was considered the underdog and losing was probably the more likely of the outcomes. She placed second in a very prestigious European tournament, and I think winning the U.S. Open was what got her invited to Moscow anyway.",

It's a fastforward! I thought we were going to see at least some character development with Beth in regards to how she acts in a relationship (because it is implied that she goes to Cincinnati) \n\nI had to turn it off. The show always sets things up but does not capitalize on them. \n\nOne episode, she has nothing in common with \"cool girls\" who have sex and listen to pop music. \n\nNext episode she is smoking weed and sleeping with college kids. \n\nShe ingests handful of tranquilizers and shes fine, wakes up as Anya Taylor Joy. Steals pills from her adoptive mother, it's ok, they stay together after the husband leaves. Husband creepy looks at her from rearview mirror, writers send him away almost immediately. \n\nThe writers make her go to bathroom during match to take tranquilizer, so she can discover the winning sequence in her mind. I can't help but imagine, there's cooler ways to do this. A flashback to Beth playing chess with custodian, Beth remembers a certain lesson and uses it to win. That's better writing...because it follows archetypes. It's much harder to write as well. \n\nEasier to just have her take a pill, cgi chess board on the cieling so the audience knows she's having a chess trip. Call it a day.",

She calls her mom to say she's going to be gone the whole weekend because she is going to Cincinnati to watch a movie. The mom asks if shes with a boy and she says yes and smiles. \n\nThen I expect to see her go to a chess tourney or something instead of actually going to Cincinnati to chase the boy. But instead...\n\nThe next scene, she is graduating high school.",

Not to be graphic, but I assume she did lose her virginity with that failed attempt on his part.\n\nFor her, it was more like \"Ok, that happened.  Sort of\".\n\n<spoiler - I'm upset I didn't recall that even when watching given how that DID link in with other similar events later>\n\nMy take - looking back - is she was trying to find SOME niche other than chess.  And failing - unless you want to call drinking a \"niche\" - which it certainly was for her.  And therefore I think that could have been a point - (though I do like the chess parallel mentioned in another comment)\n\nI mean, let's take in all in context (not completely revealed at this point) - Beth seems to WANT to \"fit in\" somewhere.  Because of events in her early life,  But it's not in family life thanks to her jerk of an adoptive dad.  It's not with the Apple Pi girls who are way too shallow for here.  And it's not even with the college guys (who she may have thought / hoped would work better since they supposedly were more mature and yet were anything but.\n\nWhere did she find \"belonging\"?  Drinking and chess - and as we'll see, not necessarily in that order.\n\nUntil later when she realizes....\n\n<trying to avoid spoilers hoping the OP keeps watching anyway>",

She gets what she wants without trying for it. Now she wants to know what she can about boys and booze. She thinks that because she's done it once, shes an expert now. \n\nThe boy was a throwaway, the first player in a tournament. He served his purpose and now she never has to think about him again.

There was something about that series of events that really struck me (as so much in the show does) but I could never put my finger on it. Something that I realised while reading your response was that although she never fit in with the high school girls, she was just as fascinated by her sexuality albeit for different reasons. By losing her virginity to an older guy (who was supposedly experienced in the matter) in an underwhelming way, the mystery surrounding sex was all but gone. As you put it, sex was just another one of the activities to which \"you're never good your first time\" was not the case for Beth. With that, she was free to prioritise other vices (for lack of a better word) like alcohol and drugs.",

Literally twelve out of the thirty competitors in the Open don't have ratings.\n\nUnless the twins were outright lying to Beth to begin with, how did Annette and ten other competitors end up in the Open without a rating?",

The twins weren't so much telling her she had to go in Beginners as advising her, since she clearly didn't understand how tournaments work, although it came across as more definite than it should have - possibly a case of the actor not really understanding the line and getting the emphasis wrong.\n\nThere are circumstances where a player has a rating which doesn't reflect their strength, and will chose to play in a higher section; there are also players in that situation who will choose to play in a lower section.\n\nChess tournaments of that kind use a Swiss system. The first round is usually seeded by rating - the player with the highest rating will play the player with the lowest rating, although the board suggests the organizers either haven't done this or have messed it up. There is also only one player with a rating of over 1800, not three as the twins claim, although Beltik isn't on the board at all, so there might have been something like a bye going on. This tournament has matched the unrated players against each other rather than treating them as low rated players.",

There are only 10 players on that list who wouldn't have been in with the beginners if the line was 1600+ which is odd. That said there was actual no rule against unrated players being in the open. This was mostly the twins trying to keep a girl out of what they thought was competition she was unready for.\n\nThe unrated players on that list were imo simply those who had chosen to be in the open. Their games would be sent in to the Chess Federation for evaluation in order to eventually get a rating. The games of the other unrated players would, most likely, not.\n\nI got the impression that if you were not in the open and only in beginners you would only play non and low rated players no matter how many wins you piled up. For players with little or no experience in tournaments this makes sense. The fee may have been less as well.",

I'm still writing my paper on The Queen's Gambit and I'm currently struggling with understanding Townes and what he is supposed to represent in the story. Specifically, what does he represent in both the novel and the Netflix adaptation? Townes plays vastly different roles in each work, to the point that he doesn't even show up after Beth's Las Vegas tournament. \n\nI'm sure Townes represents something more than just \"the pretty boy/crush\" in the book but I can't figure it out. If you have an idea or understanding of what he represents can you share it with me in the replies? Thank you in advance to everyone!",

Gay sexual relations was literally illegal then.  Gays were certainly NOT accepted then.\n\nNow Townes said himself he was confused.  To me that meant Beth made him wonder \"wait - maybe I'm NOT gay??\"\n\nBeth \"broke his heart in that (I think) she seemed to be upset over realizing he was gay (the guy walking in was the only real indication)\n\nTownes wanted to be friends - very important to realize that in the 60s, a guy and girl (usually) were not platonic friends.  (I grew up in the 60s; guys generally only \"liked\" girls as a girlfriend material.  I always assumed girls felt similar.   And of course that idea was still VERY prevalent in the movie \"When Harry Met Sally\" in 1989\n\nIt took a LONG time before people accepted you can have strong feelings for someone of the opposite sex without actually wanting to HAVE sex with them.\n\nIt's THAT idea that I think Townes represents to me.  As a straight married male (father/grandfather) who over the years found good friendship with 3 different women over the past 40 plus years.\n\nNOTE - typed quickly and I may edit later\n\nI LOVED Queen's Gambit!\n\nFirst edit already -\n\nThis idea of guys/girls only as \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" is officially dead I believe.

There is only one scene I know of in which two characters both in white interact - the racketball game, and that, of course, is not Chess. The summer Beth and Harry spend together is particularly instructive here - watch it, and pay attention to who is wearing white or dark colors and how it affects their interactions. It includes one scene where Beth takes off a dark top to reveal a white shirt - and Harry in black, seemingly about to act, is set back. When Chloe phones up from the hotel lobby in Paris, Beth answers wearing white but comes down to the bar in dark red (the most common color of the dark pieces after black). She's gone from in control to following.\n\nThe other scene in which a character goes from black to white is the hotel scene with Townes. Watch Beth's reaction to him taking off his sweater. There's a lot to unpack there, and it's not clear how much Beth really knows or guesses about Townes' private life or his intentions at any point in that scene - the focus is on Beth's face when Roger appears too - what does she infer? It's also quite possible to read Roger's speech as a signal to Townes that he's giving him a pass to sleep with Beth - does Townes seem to you like someone who would forget when dinner is? So why does Roger remind him exactly when he will be returning to their room - to avoid interrupting them? Does Beth pick up on this? Is Townes later apology related to it? And why does Roger change into green trunks - a color usually seen on Beth in her moments of sickness or addiction?",

                "comment_text": "Thinking out loud: It strikes me that Beth lives in a world that is very black and white, governed by chess - but she learns that relationships are not black and white. She doesn't have much experience with trustworthy people in her life: abandoned by her parents, and her adoptive father, and let's not forget Cleo. It might be that she only understands relationships as either ***for*** or ***against*** her. But Townes represents a grey area (which is why it is so beautiful that their doomed attraction to each other can resolve in the very last episode as friendship). I think the same applies to Harry and Benny (moving from competitors to love interests to friends) and Jolene (who stole her book - and in the novel approached Beth in the night) who becomes a mentor and friend. Similarly, her relationship with Mr Shaibel is very unusual, meeting as equal minds in spite of their difference in age. Even Alma inhabits a grey space: as adoptive mother she quickly turns into more of a sister figure for Beth and sometimes Beth mothers her instead. To me Townes is the pinnacle of this ambivalence in Beth's relationships and the fact that they end up as friends symbolises the maturity Beth has found so she can function as human being in relationships and not just within the black-and-white constraints of the game that governed her whole mind. This growth curve runs parallel to her growth in chess right from the start when she is orphaned and finally ends up with a sense of belonging. Being able to hold and accept that fluidity in her relationships when they are so much more complicated than the rules on the 64 squares means that Beth ends the series in a place of calm and confidence.",

Green is used to represent Beth's comfort: the green pills that make her feel safe, the green squares that remind her of Mr. Shaibel, the green chair she sits in after Mrs. Wheatley dies, etc. Alternatively, blue is represented to symbolize Beth's discomfort. The blue of the Wheatley's home when she moves in, the blue she wears to the Apple Pi meeting, etc. \n\nHowever, I didn't notice the black and white symbolism in the series!

                "comment_text": "I have not read the book.  My impression is that the director saw potential in the story to explore themes the book did not touch on.  To me it seem as if it's sort of a retelling of the story with new / different aspects\n\nFairly common I'd say.  Bad example perhaps, but I see that in \"superhero\" movies where aspects of a character (say, Batman as vigilante) are explored.\n\nSo comparison to the book may not be relevant other than to point out the director took the main idea and added / changed to make certain points not present in the book nor intended to be.\n\nRegarding your first question - I'm not sure Townes literally represents \"platonic friendship\".  In fact, I'd say that was not the intent at all.  If anything, he represents confusion gay people likely felt in the 60s (and still feel even today).  The platonic aspect is something that spoke to me personally (unimportant, but my first true friend that happened to be female occurred during my first job out of college mid 1970s.  My wife was concerned about that to say the least - but once she met her and we socialized as couples (she was married too) it was no issue.  But the idea of a man/woman being platonic friends even in the 70s was met with suspicion.\n\nSo I'd not go so far as to say Townes represented that.  But I do feel they wanted to make a subtle statement about being gay in the 60s.  It SEEMED like Beth thought Townes was leading her on - and in a sense he actually was.  But as he said, he was confused.  One might imagine he talked in more detail about that to her but we don't see that because the series was about her, not him.\n\nThe \"platonic\" aspect DOES come through loud and clear at the end when all her (male) friends rally around her to help her win.  That's the only aspect I thought was maybe TOO perfect.  But it made the point that she didn't need to feel abandoned; there WERE people who cared.  And that caring was NOT based on her being a woman and them being men.  It was person to person.  Caring and respectful friends.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nAnd you NEED to include the points made by the other poster regarding clothes and color.  I did not catch that at all but it's very insightful.  Roger Ebert once said there are NO coincidences in movies.  EVERY aspect is intentional no matter if it's obvious or not.\n\nThe more obvious one I saw was her dressing in checks.  Remember she said she felt safe in the world of the chessboard - the 64 squares.  The chessboard was her world and she dressed like it.\n\nUntil she won with the help of people who cared deeply for her.  She walked through the park dressed like the white queen.  Now - the world was her chessboard.\n\nVery corny to say it out loud, but that's the point.  The series have those things without hitting us over the head.\n\n\\----------------\n\nLike what happened when she felt drawn to Shiable's \"office\" and saw the clippings.  She said she'd never go back in but I guess felt compelled.  It hit her that someone DID care and she cried to Jolene.  But a corny director would have dialog like \"Oh Jolene - what have I become??\" and then the theme from Rocky would play indicating her turnaround.\n\n\\-------------\n\nSpeaking of which, I think the Jolene character is played very different than the book.  And I think perhaps STILL underplayed in the series.  She is the one who set the turnaround all in motion.  Again, it's subtle but remember this is the south in the 60s.  Whites / blacks weren't generally true friends.  I actually wondered about them playing racquetball.  I'm sure some people would have looked at them together and thought \"WTF?\"\n\nIn the movie Brian's Song (true story) set in the mid/late 60s, black and white  football players being friends (and roommates on the road) was unusual and even unheard of in some sense.\n\nSo the idea that Beth DID have people who cared AND they came from EVERYWHERE, not the \"normal\" places, was powerful.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nSorry for the length - but one more.  The girl who was inspired by Beth to get a medical degree.  VERY significant.  Again, it's the 60s.  Women were said to go to college to meet a successful guy.  To get their \"MRS\" degree,  Women generally were teachers, nurses.  not DOCTORS!!  I told my (adult) son that was VERY powerful.  It went over his head - he thought \"so what\".  The time period of this is a social commentary of its own.\n\n\\-----------\n\nWhew.  that was a real mind dump.  Did I mention I LOVED Queen's Gambit?",

He looks like the 1950s rather than the 1960s. You could take this a step further and consider whether his sexual unavailability marks him out as s Father figure.\n\nGoing with my reading of the hotel scene - that Roger is offering Townes permission to sleep with Beth, and the implication that either Townes is bisexual or that Roger has encouraged him to be more adventurous, but Townes rejects the opportunity - he is strictly monogamous. Maybe that's why Roger is in green trunks - he represents the wrong turn, that sickly green being the color of danger for Beth. Townes is also not a gambler, even when Roger is at the Baccarat table. Townes is safe.\n\nAnd that's why Townes reappears when he does, and not before. Beth couldn't achieve stability with Alma, Benny or Harry. She's reached a point in her career where stability is achievable, and while that's not going to be in a relationship with Townes, his return foreshadows her transcendence of her troubles.",

Because its a bit hard to get into her head like in the book.\n\nAlso he knows her hotel room cause he already met her at the match, so Beth must have invited him in to stay for the night",

                "comment_text": "I can tell how much you love this show and it resonates with me so much as well. It's a very interesting perspective to consider that the show attempted to tackle different themes from the book. I want to also make it as clear as possible that I loved the show so much that I bought and read the book (something that I've never done for any other show) and I criticize it out of a place of kindness in what it could've been. \n\nSince you haven't read the book, I want to say that Beth overcomes her addiction through her self-control and by reaching out for help, unlike what happened in the show. Unlike the show, Beth goes out of her way to search for Jolene and asks her for help and advice. That's one of the most often complaints that I've heard about the show: that \"the drugs won\" and in a way they did because the show does not put the focus on her overcoming her addiction and instead on her relationships to others. Another criticism I hear (and share) is that the Beth in the book seeks out help while the Beth in the show is offered help. \n\n\\-----\n\nAs for the Townes section, that's a great perspective I hadn't thought of. Originally I was under the impression that Townes was put in for representation - and while I'm sure that was part of the reason - I now understand the greater role he played.\n\n\\-----\n\nAs for the color symbolism, that might be my favorite aspect of both works. I've already included the color symbolism of green and blue in the book but I hadn't considered the symbolism of black and white in regard to chess. I think there are a few spots that the show missed such as Beth buying a green-squared chessboard (just like Mr. Shaibel's) when she moves in with Mrs. Wheatley but I will have to go back and compare both of them with regard to the symbolism of black and white color usage.\n\n\\-----\n\nJolene. You are more right than you know when you say Jolene played a different role in the book. The only differences I found between the show and book regarding Jolene are two examples:   \n1) When Beth arrives at the orphanage, Jolene r\\*pes her and   \n2) Beth reaches out to Jolene for help instead of Jolene showing up on her doorstep\n\nI think the 1st example is completely unnecessary in the book because it has no effect on Beth, the plot, or any other part of the book. I don't understand why it was in the book so I don't consider it a relevant scene or even a necessary one since it has no impact on the story.\n\n\\-----\n\nPlease don't apologize for the long post! I love these kinds of in depth conversations and detailed examples! :) \n\nIn fact, my paper is nearing 20 pages and will easily go over 30 as of now. So I'm definitely no stranger when it comes to a detailed breakdown. \n\nTo clarify then, do you mean that the Netflix adaptation decided to tackle the theme of defying gender roles or expectations more than the addiction that Beth struggles with? \n\nIf yes, do you think Townes was part of the new theme?\n\nIf no, can you edit my clarification to your description?\n\n\\-----\n\nI loved The Queen's Gambit too! <3 (if I didn't make it clear enough yet :) )",

(Besides the wearing checks and then the \"white queen\" symbolism.\n\nBeth was tough to like even though we saw what she was going through.  I mean - KNOWING your mother WANTED her to die along with her?\n\nSo she built a wall around her (BTW, I absolutely was hearing Pink Floyd's \"another brick in the wall\" after a while.  Hey, I'm a \"boomer\".  Dad and grandpa.Don't hold it against me!\n\nBut when it was revealed she didn't pay back Schaible I thought - enough is enough.  My younger son (an avid chess player in HS, now in his 30s and a dad himself) was done watching the series and we had been texting a LOT about it. NO spoilers though.\n\nAt that point I turned off the TV and said to him - that's it.  I can't watch anymore.  I'm disgusted.\n\nHe said - \"dad, hang in there.  You are SUPPOSED to be disgusted.  That's what makes what happens next work so perfectly.\n\nHe of course was right.  Without that realization in the church service, Beth would not have felt drawn to going back in despite saying she never would.  And then all that followed from that.\n\nI get the impression the book didn't do it that way.  I almost feel the show was a VERY different story.\n\nOne more quick one - more to come later.  I understand your point that book showed Beth helping herself.\n\nI might say though that is a VERY different message than the movie has.  Both are powerful, both are thought provoking.  But the idea of a person understandably building a wall around themselves - and having people to care enough to help her despite that - resonated with me more.\n\nAre you familiar with mbti?  Beth is characterized as an INTJ.  I am an INTP.  Both types very much \"loners\" on the surface.\n\nBut the main difference between the two is INTJs tend to be focused and driven to succeed at what they are focused on.  INTP tend to bounce from one interest to another - knowing enough to convince themselves they COUDL master it but move on to something else.\n\nYet both types have a tendency to think \"I don't' need anyone else\".\n\n(I may have just added another 5-10 pages to your paper!)\n\nYou see, it touches me when I realize people that understand me care about me even though it can seem as if I don't' care about them.  I don't' mean family.  Of course we care.  I mean a couple of close friends.\n\nEDIT - sorry I don't' have time for the post above; hopefully tomorrow.  Don't worry - I do enjoy sharing thoughts / opinions with you.  And anyone reading - feel free to chime in!!",

There must be other examples of that .  \n\nTrivial but I DO know that happens a lot with super-heroes.  Retelling of the origin story of Superman or Batman.  Key figures playing expanded or very different roles Etc.\n\nI think that's evident in what you've been saying - and speaking ONLY for myself, I like the series version better.  The theme there is \"we DO need other people no matter how accomplished we are.  ESPECIALLY when life has created a very understandable need for us to build a wall around us to protect us",

While in Mexico, Alma was trying to get Beth to take a break before the tournament started. Beth was reading about end games. Beth had a book after she and Harry had sex. No titles of these three books were visible, that I saw. There could be other scenes where she is reading but I can\u2019t recall them at the moment.\n\nThe night Harry first came over, they went through a list of books she had read,  it she wasn\u2019t shown reading them.",

Like Beth he stands out from the crowd, a rebel. Its confirmed that he\u2019s attracted to her for the same reason cause she is also a rebel. Having Benny dress/looks like Harry or the twins would defeat the purpose of his character and would make him uninteresting",

So, acting is not secondary but essential. \n\nI guess, Queens Gambit is just not for you if you haven\u2019t enjoyed the character drama and the dynamics between the actors and their respective characters on its own. Nothing I could say could change that, if you\u2019re viewing experience wasn\u2019t good. \n\nWhat I love about the series is these characters that I have formed a bond with. It intrigues me to see Beth going through her highs and lows, losing her ambition and getting it back, discovering sexuality, trying to overcome her affinity for drugs and most importantly maturing. Combined with the great set pieces, costumes, camera work and soundtrack, the world of Queens Gambit is able to make me feel at home. It is a masterpiece from this perspective.",

When I watched the show I loved it so much that I wanted to read the original source material. I ordered the book and read it when it arrived. After finishing the book I saw so many flaws with the show to the point that the show looks awful compared to the book. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not asking about thoughts on cinematography, lighting, set design, etc. I want to know - from the perspective of characters and their development, personality, etc. (imagine you only had the script to judge) - what made Beth and the other characters good and what good means to you in this context.\n\nThank you for responses in advance.",

Maybe a bit of both? I feel like her cocky and overconfident personality really helped the scenes where she lost feel more impactful. Since she starts as a prodigy who feels superior to others without considering if she has any flaws of her own. And when she loses in the book it allows the reader to empathize more with her from multiple different points: the confidence everyone\u2019s had at some point in their lives only to have been proven wrong, the display of Beth\u2019s more human, less calculating side, and the eventual payoff where she grows as a person as well. I felt that her cocky personality helped her feel more relatable and complete as a person, especially considering any child who is praised as a genius at such a young age would not be able to handle their ego very well yet.

This allowed threads to be seen without being touched years after they were posted to give people an idea of how discussions and engagements were treated at the time, or before certain information was made available. While I wholeheartedly disagree with that being suddenly switched on by default site-wide, this is a sub that can definitely benefit from it. A few points:\n\nOur episode discussion guides are now reopened and restickied. People can continue to comment and reply in each thread, both new viewers and old. A while back, I was planning on organizing a rewatch, but shortly after my life became a bit more hectic, so I apologize for that falling through. I'd still like to do it, maybe sometime soon especially since the show will become 1 year old this Saturday (wow!).\n\nOld threads on obscure topics can continue. If someone really wanted to talk about a specific outfit Beth wore, or something that happened in a specific scene, you can still reply to people and discuss in old threads without making a new thread that may not get much attention and discussion. \n\nLastly, this will make it basically impossible to keep an eye on every thread. No mod team, no matter how big, can keep an eye on every single post and thread in their entire sub. We will be heavily relying on you to use the report button, especially on these old threads. I can't see this being a big problem here, this is a pretty chill sub but just wanted to make you aware, in the future you may see a nasty comment made 4 months ago that no one ever read because it's on a 1 year old post. It's up to you to inform us of these. \n\nAnd that's about it, pretty straight forward. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!\n\nJabrono",

                "comment_text": "That's... *one* perspective to take...\n\nHere's another. The queens gambit is about control and trust. Beths biological mother did not trust the biological father to be fit to help her raise her child. So she took control and Beth away from him. And when she couldn't handle it anymore (due to psychological reasons) she decided to end her life as a last show of control. (In the book Beth isn't with her).\n\nThe orphanage takes complete control over Beth. Body and mind. They controled how she looks, what she wears, what she can and cannot do. They controled her mind with drugs. Mr. Shaible controled her at first. Dismissing her. Then always plaing white (first). He didn't trust her to be a worthy oponent. But through time, she earned his trust. Until the orphanage took control over her and forbade it. \n\nWhen Beth was adopted, her new parents didn't trust her. Beth had to fight for every bit of control over her own life. What little she could use her money on. Stealing the rest. She mistrusted everyone. And with good reasons. Then on the toilet at the tournament, she had no choice but to trust the other girl. Because she couldn't contol what was happening to her body. \n\nThe now somewhat famous quote about the 64 squares that she can control. Reflecting how she still doesn't really trust anything outside of it. \n\nHer relation with Alma was built on trust. Slowly. To the point where Beth trusted her enough to tell her she spends the night with others and Alma trusting her not to do something stupid.  Giving *her child* more and more control as it grows up. They both took control over their time together, even lying to the school. Alma finally trusting Beth enough to ask her for a share of the money knowing she wouldn't outright laugh in her face. Beth feeling her trust betrayed when Alma spent way too much time with that mexican, who in turn betrayed Almas trust, just like her husband did. Beth trying to retain control over her emotions when Alma dies. \n\nBeth then trying to control her life. Even trying to somewhat control her relation to Beltik and Watts, learning she can't. She tries to trust them, but never really. She can't control others. She can't control what they think of her. She can only control herself. So when she wears fancy clothes, she doesn't do it to impress others, she does it, because she can. \n\nBut the drugs and alcohol still control her. She trusts Jolene enough to let her help her. Regaining control over her addiction to some extend. \n\nBorgov controls her. Wipes the floor with her twice. Controls her thoughts. She fought alone and lost and lost again. In russia, she was controled by that agent, most likely her every step was monitored by the KGB. Only when she gave up control and trusted her friends she was ready to fight back. And then, ultimately, she had to learn to trust *herself*, not the drugs, that she can win and she did. Finally able to let go of that need for control. Just playing the game and trusting the one on the other side to just want to play the game, too. \n\nNo politics, no agenda, just two people playing a game. \n\nNow... to be honest, I just pulled most of that out of a certain body part of mine... but it fits, doesn't it? Maybe it even fits more than some thin interpretation Tevis wrote it to either appraise or deconstruct the american dream. \n\nYes, the rags to ritches, underdog to victory story is pretty american, but what I loved about the story is how *little* a role politics playes. It wasn't america versus russia. It was Beth versus Borgov, which just happens to be a russian, because, well... chess. Beth is so ultimately not a typical american hero. And every time someone tries to force that lable on her (the church ladies, the agent, the press) it's almost played for laughs and she outright refuses. \n\nBeth never cared about ideology. She just wanted to play good, challenging chess.",

True control of one's life nescessitates the giving up of the need for complete control and instead,  trusttng in yourself and improvising. \nIts there. \nThe theme of control and learning to trust plays out in the plot... big time but still, you can't ignore the context. \n\nThe cold war era was dominated by politics and ideological diffetences between the USSR and America.\n\nThe American angle is not thin, if you read the whole article. The film projects a new kind of American persona that cares * More about individuality and excellence than about America.\n\nDespite her geniune lack of interest in politics and in society, she beomes an inspiration and a symbol. * I kind of like the American heroine as *self before country*.

Anything and everything published at that time did its darndest to portray the USA as the shining good guys and the USSR as cold hearted monsters. But not in this book. \n\nI can only take it as a very concious decision by Tevis to *not* play into these patriotic stereotypes. He could easily have made the US look better and the USSR worse than he did. But he didn't. Again, anyone even remotely trying to go in that direction is not portrayed in a favourable light in that story. Tevis showed that there are humans on both sides. And especially the top players on both sides are crucially not defined by their country of origin or their political views or values. They just want to play a game and see who is the better player. \n\nIf he foresaw the very recent development of \"self before country\" at *that* time, then wow... he's a prophet.

And,  I believe that Tevis works against that overly simplistic view of the world and against that political agenda, which I really like, btw. I like the truthfulness of his presentation. The game matters most. \n\nBut then, its the individualism that wins and inspires,  which goes back to the American value of \"individualism\".\n\nYou can't forget that the main political conflict between the USSR and the USA at the time was individualism versus collectivism. That was at the heart of the cold war. \n\nHarmon wins over Borgov because she's playing with the creative freedom that only an individual mindset can access. Borgov's chess game - and all the Soviet players - are limited by the Soviet system.  They cannot grow outside that box. Harmon wins because she is not controlled by a collective. \n\nThe USA is far from fantasy, but it is better than the Soviets because of its support of the individual. That's Tevis final statement. The USA did not only work against her genius. The school chess club helped her. She competed, and the chess society recognized and encouraged her to compete more and to succeed.\n\nThe USA is flawed. The Soviet Union's also flawed. The USA is better only in that it supports the individual and his/her pursuit of excellence, a dream, happiness.",

Beth struggles her whole life because she doesn't belong, doesn't fit in. She is *lucky* enough to be very good at chess. If she wasn't, she'd have *nothing* to connect to people with. \n\nOne of the happy hollywood moments in the finale is, when she get's the call from her \"friends\". She felt alone and miserable, but now *together* they can work on a strategy. Just like the russians did. And this working together to achieve a common goal was always portrayed as the biggest strength the russians had. \n\nSure, in the end she won going off plan and doing her thing. But that was one thing one time. A blip on the radar, a curiosity. It wasn't even the world championship. The world of chess is still firmly in the grip of the russians and their way of learning, teaching and living it. \n\nAnd it is a very american view to think that you can only achieve excellence and happiness through individualism.",

Is there anyone who knows about \"institutionalized kids\" -- the ones raised in orphanages, not foster care? What do you think about Beth character?\n\nOrphanages are, fortunately, eliminated in the USA, but I am from Russia, my close friend was involved in orphanage-related charities, so I saw some and read about some -- though not nearly enough to be an \"expert\". \n\nStill, I am struggling with \"I don't buy it\" moments about Beth. The biggest issue from my point of view: she spent 7 years in an orphanage, how come she is so highly functional, without noticeable period of rehabilitation? \n\n- she knows what is money, how they work and immediately understands what \"allowance\" is. It does not look like in the orphanage they ever took kids shopping, let alone explained things about \"entrance fees\"\n\n- she understands fashion. She knows right away that the coat Alma bought for her is ugly and poor fitting. When she starts buying clothes for herself, she shows very good and sophisticated taste. From what I heard, read and seen about institution-raised kids - they lack taste, I read foster parents complaining that a kid doesn't even have a favorite color. You cannot develop taste when you never get to choose clothes for yourself.\n\n- Beth has serious problems connecting with people outside of the orphanage circle, but still manages quite well. She has no lack of empathy and she successfully contains her anger, without throwing tantrums or outbursts.\n\n- At school, she tries to eat bread with a fork and knife - at least, that fits.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Beth a realistic character?",

Now you pull this crap? No, you can fucking well go alone.\u201d\n\nThis gives us insight into how Benny felt when Beth declined to come back to New York right after Paris: he felt that she rejected him, that she\u2019d rather live a life as an alcoholic than be with him. (Whether she actually said this isn\u2019t important \u2014 we just need to know that this is how he felt).\n\nNow imagine if your crush, and someone you hooked up with, told you something like, \u201cI\u2019d rather be alone and an addict than be with you\u201d. I know I would feel sad, hurt, and embarrassed. I suspect nearly everyone would. Would you then, after they told you this, drive across the country to be with them? I bet not (and again, I think this would be nearly everyone\u2019s response). People are too embarrassed to even double text when their crush doesn\u2019t text back! \n\nMaybe Jane Austen said it best: \u201cThere are few of us who are secure enough to be within love without proper encouragement.\u201d",

He has his circle of friends and everything he\u2019s familiar with, keeping Beth at a guest disadvantage. This had always been his MO though? He visibly enjoyed having the psychological/emotional high ground over her in Vegas and Ohio and I think he thought he\u2019d yielded enough with the title and being so gracious as to train her. Plus she was obvious about her feelings for him, so he figured she would want to keep chasing him down until she\u2019d \u201cwon\u201d, because that had always been her MO with all things chess.

One does wonder why he didn't go see her if he missed her and cared about her - their conversation on the plane was really *soft* and he sounded genuinely worried that she would end up in a bad place if left alone to drink, pleading with her to come to NY instead. And yet when she gently thanked him and insisted she wanted to go home to lick her wounds, he left her to crash and burn alone, just like he'd predicted.  That is a bit contradictory, right?",

                "comment_text": "Super interesting analysis! Can I offer some pushback?\n\n1. \"Benny tells Beth what to do and she obeys\". I think this might undercut some of Beth's own agency. \n\nA) When Beth loses to Benny in Vegas, for example, we hear her tell Alma: \"I wanted to show that fucking pirate that I could beat him even though I didn't play the way he thought I should.\" This speaks to Beth as someone who does not simply obey others, *especially* not Benny. She's explicitly stating how she's aiming to resist following what he thinks is best.\n\nB) We get a flashback to Beth's mother saying, \"Men are gonna come along and wanna teach you things. You just let them blow-by, and you go on ahead and do just what the hell you feel like.\" It seems like Beth took this to heart: she doesn't accept Mr. Shaibel's refusal to teach her chess, and she also doesn't accept the twins telling her she can't play in the open section in Kentucky. There's a track record of Beth not simply obeying any men -- why think that she does simply obey Benny?\n\nNow, you're totally right that there are examples where Benny does tell Beth what to do: when he announces that they're going to NY from Ohio, when he tells her to call the Christian organization, etc. But there's a difference between \"obeying\" and \"acquiescing\". Obeying implies a recognition of authority. Acquiescing merely implies that she accepts what he's saying. Why think that she obeys, instead of merely acquiesces? \n\n2. \"he gets to make the rules for the apartment (No booze, study from the crack of dawn, no sex until he decides it\u2019s what he wants, oh his friends are coming over you can\u2019t sleep)\".   \nIt's not, I think, fully obvious that Benny sets down these rules and that Beth obeys.\n\nA) When Cleo offers Beth a drink in Benny's basement, Beth and Benny make eye contact (S1E6 10:59). Benny waits to see Beth's reply and, after a pause, she declines the offer with a simple, \"No, thank you.\" This, I think, suggests that she has the choice to accept the drink or not. If she has the choice, then she isn't just obeying a rule set by Benny about drinking.\n\nAlso, in the same episode at (5:12) Benny says, \"Oh, there's no booze in the apartment.\" and Beth replies, \"Didn't think there would be.\" This, I think, also suggests that Benny is not setting a rule for drinking. It seems like he's merely offering a descriptive statement of there being no alcohol in the apartment. Beth's response suggests that she understands him in this way. If he were laying down a rule that she were obeying here, her response would be an acknowledgement of that as a rule.\n\nB) After Beth has showered and changed, Benny wants to start training (same episode, 6:27). Beth says that she needs breakfast first (same episode, 6:50). Benny acquiesces saying, \"Eggs are in the fridge. Then we'll play the Borgov games first.\" \n\nThis small interaction suggests, I think, that Beth does not just obey Benny. Benny wants them to train right away, Beth demands breakfast first, then Benny acquiesces. It seems like Beth pushes back on Benny's authority, and only does things the way she wants to. She doesn't obey -- she agrees, and only on her terms.\n\nC) I think you're right that Benny rules that there will be no sex, but I'm not sure the No Sex rule is problematic. If someone doesn't want to have sex, for any reason, then surely everyone should obey that rule. In this case, Benny doesn't want to have sex and then sets a No Sex rule. It is a good thing that Beth obeys that rule. \n\nD) You're right that Benny doesn't let Beth sleep when his friends come over. Fair enough.\n\nSorry for the super long comment. I just really enjoy your perspective on Benny's character and I love analyzing the show. Let me know what you think if you have the time!",

I felt like he was just in mentor mode which is very reasonable to be strict on certain things and implementing rules. I feel like I\u2019ve seen that trope in fiction where a mentor/trainer figure is treating the mentee/trainee like that (in 99% of these examples the dynamics were the same sex, so I can see how one may be like \u201cwoah\u201d when a male mentor and female mentee is present which is rarely seen in media) but ya just considering other mentor/trainer-mentee/trainee dynamics, his behavior never came off to me as toxic with a misogyny as a basis.\n\nI really don\u2019t see anything wrong with him establishing the boundary of no sex. She was also the one who instigated it. I felt he reacted and delivered his response to her in the way he did because he was able to tell that her advances were driven by lust & not being in the right head space as she was drinking and he really didn\u2019t want to ruin the \u201cprofessional\u201d relationship they had so quickly. I also feel like he was considering how she was cold and sassy for a lot of the time (and not considering his own history in having condescending energy towards her when they first meet or his smartass attitude in Vegas) only for her to basically switch up & be like \u201cwanna fuck?\u201d I\u2019d scoff too. So ya, it really did feel reasonable to me. And it was understandable that with time he changed his mind on it because he got to know Beth more and imo i feel like he fell for her (which explains why he was upset later). \n\nI also feel like it was reasonable to set rules in his apartment (like no booze) & his training guidelines. And then about him telling her they\u2019re going to NY from Ohio, pretty sure she asked him what the plan was? \n\nI can understand the take on him enjoying a psychological high ground to her in Vegas to a degree, but he didn\u2019t even really know her at the time so it makes sense to me why he\u2019d have a sort of competitive smartass attitude to him. She was just an opponent to him at the time.\n\nI definitely get that Benny is a flawed character and had his own issues for sure, but I don\u2019t think it had to do with internalized misogyny. I actually really appreciated him because I felt like he wasn\u2019t misogynistic imo; he was willing to talk game and strategy with her, he acknowledged & praised her for being the best, offered to train her, and seemed to (imo) genuinely care for her & her mental health. I agree with chopsticks95\u2019s comment and their reply to you for the most part.",

I was noting a pattern in behaviour to explain why Benny keeps asking Beth to come to him in NY instead of going to her himself, which was OP's original question. Beth's agency has never been in doubt - the whole reason Benny is flabbergasted is that she's acting, of her own free will, in a way that conflicts with what he expected, when previously she would sometimes protest or balk a little, but ultimately agree that his way was best.  There are obviously other factors here, including their trainer/student relationship and how he's almost a decade older and much more experienced. But this is the first time she's just given him a hard no, and I think it's obvious why he sees that with consternation and surprise beyond the hurt romantic feelings.\n\nAlso: I'm trying to look at this question from Benny's perspective. I think he thinks she was obeying, because he does do things like rattle off orders (\"Study the pamphlets and call the Jesus people back\") even if Beth only thinks she's agreeing/acquiescing. Like she can protest and squeeze in showering and eating first, but he's already decided the main schedule of what they are going to be doing that day and in what order, and you can see his impatience with her deviating from His Plan! You'll also notice that she doesn't insist on some other games first - she goes along with what he's decided even though she's side-eyeing his decisions sometimes (\"ALL of them?\")\n\n*When Cleo offers Beth a drink in Benny's basement, Beth and Benny make eye contact (S1E6 10:59). Benny waits to see Beth's reply and, after a pause, she declines the offer with a simple, \"No, thank you.\" This, I think, suggests that she has the choice to accept the drink or not. If she has the choice, then she isn't just obeying a rule set by Benny about drinking.*\n\nHmm, I disagree with this interpretation. I think that look meant that she was checking what he would think - note her hesitation and the way she deliberately turns to look at him before answering for herself. And when she refused Cleo's offer, you'll note Benny's approving nod and smile. She brings it up later to him too, like a point of pride that she's stayed \"sober as a judge\" even though the rest of them were drinking. So if she's not obeying what she sees as his rule for her, she's definitely seeking his approval, at least.",

He said: \u201cAs a film, it becomes more of a sports movie with cut-out characters: it\u2019s simply, \u2018Is she going to win [or] won\u2019t she win?\u2019 I had wanted to focus on the cost of genius\u2026 I set about reimagining it in six parts and turned it into seven parts post-production,\u201d. \n\n(Source: https://www.indiewire.com/2021/05/the-queens-gambit-scott-frank-netflix-blockbuster-emmys-1234637912/ )\n\nI think Frank is making an interesting point. He\u2019s not saying that you can\u2019t make The Queen\u2019s Gambit as a movie. Rather, his point is that the story will be simplified down in a movie form. We\u2019d lose the complexity of the characters, and we\u2019d lose the focus on \u201cthe cost of genius\u201d that the show currently has.\n\nBut this raises a question: is it still the same story if we lose the focus on \u201cthe cost of genius\u201d? I personally think not. The heart of the show  \u2014 and so much of what makes the series compelling \u2014 is the focus on Beth as she struggles with loneliness and addiction (which I take to be the cost of genius, as portrayed by the show). Beating Borgov is, in my humble opinion, not really what the story is about. So telling a version of the story focusing only on beating Borgov, and not on her struggle to find connection with others / to overcome her addictions, would be essentially telling a different story. Unless a movie could also fit this focus in \u2014 which seems unlikely since movies are like 2 hours, and the series is like 6.5 hours \u2014 I think it\u2019s not possible to tell the story as a movie.",

She was not an important player by their standards; the only unusual thing about her was her sex, and even that wasn\u2019t unique in Russia. There was Nona Gaprindashvili, not up to the level of this tournament, but a player who had met all these Russian grandmasters many times before. Laev would be expecting an easy win.\u201d\n\nThey remained really faithful to the source material too, on so many fronts, so it really sticks out that they deliberately changed this.",

However, the allegations are thin, to say the least: they claim the fact the the false statement was added and was not in the book, and that they hired chess experts as advisers, and that they didn\u2019t offer an apology and retraction, could demonstrate actual malice.

And the little changes they did seem to come from a place of love for the source and not some weirdly misguided attempt to make it more \"compatible\" for a mass audience. For the most part.\n\nAny hint of \"KGB wants to distract/stop Beth\" is noticably missing in the book. A book written in 1983. The height of the cold war. Feels like a deliberate decision.

The KGB also did not know he was gay and so he does not get her drunk or distract her like the KGB had planned.

Did I miss something?\n\nAt timestamp 38:22 in the episode she moves a rook and her king. I don't understand that move was it a mistake? Or do I just not know how to play chess? Her king was moved over 2 spaces and the rook was moved to the other side of it...what was that?",

Let's say a chess game. And you don't know the rules of the game, but you're allowed to look at the board from time to time, in a little corner, perhaps. And from these observations, you try to figure out what the rules are of the game, what [are] the rules of the pieces moving.\n>\n> You might discover after a bit, for example, that when there's only one bishop around on the board, that the bishop maintains its color. Later on you might discover the law for the bishop is that it moves on a diagonal, which would explain the law that you understood before, that it maintains its color. And that would be analogous we discover one law and later find a deeper understanding of it.\n>\n> Ah, then things can happen--everything's going good, you've got all the laws, it looks very good--and then all of a sudden some strange phenomenon occurs in some corner, so you begin to investigate that, to look for it. It's castling--something you didn't expect.\n>\n> We're always, by the way, in a fundamental physics, always trying to investigate those things in which we don't understand the conclusions. We're not trying to all the time check our conclusions; after we've checked them enough, they're okay. The thing that doesn't fit is the thing that's most interesting--the part that doesn't go according to what you'd expect.\n>\n> Also we can have revolutions in physics. After you've noticed that the bishops maintain their color and that they go along on the diagonals and so on, for such a long time, and everybody knows that that's true; then you suddenly discover one day in some chess game that the bishop doesn't maintain its color, it changes its color. Only later do you discover the new possibility that the bishop is captured and that a pawn went all the way down to the queen's end to produce a new bishop. That could happen, but you didn't know it.\n>\n> And so it's very analogous to the way our laws are. They sometimes look positive, they keep on working, and all of a sudden, some little gimmick shows that they're wrong--and then we have to investigate the conditions under which this bishop changed color... happened... and so on... And gradually we learn the new rule that explains it more deeply.\n>\n> Unlike the chess game, though... In the case of the chess game, the rules become more complicated as you go along, but in the physics when you discover new things, it becomes more simple. It appears on the whole to be more complicated, because we learn about a greater experience; that is, we learn about more particles and new things, and so the laws look complicated again. But if you realize that all of the time, what's kind of wonderful is that as we expand our experience into wilder and wilder regions of experience, every once in a while we have these integration in which everything is pulled together in a unification, which it turns out to be simpler than it looked before.",

When the husband left and Beth offered to work to have a little income, Alma outright refused.\n\nWhen Alma saw that chess \"worked\", she was of course enthusiastic about it. But it was still all on Beths terms. Eventually she pulled her courage together to ask her for a (comparatively low) percentage of the winnings. \n\nAlma wanted a daughter first. Someone to love and to love her back. She enjoyed travelling with Beth more *because* it was with Beth than the travelling itself. Just like Beth did. And Alma was almost afraid to ask for the percentage, because she feared she might lose Beth over it. \n\nThere could have been so many bad tropes; the mother forbidding the child to do what they're good at and the child needing to go behind the mothers back and all that mistrust and betrayal and stuff. I was so glad that ***none*** of that was present here. Alma and Beth are not the typical mother/daughter roles. But they definitely cared deeply about each other and there was a lot of trust. You don't spend the night with guys and call your mother before without huge trust that you won't spend the next years locked up in your room. And as a mother you don't let your daughter stay without trusting she won't do anything stupid.\n\nNow, was Alma a \"very good mother\"? Who knows... I don't think there is one all encompassing definition that even two people could fully agree upon. But the alcoholism (which Beth inherited) is definitely a strong point against it. Was she a good mother *for Beth*? Yeah, Beth needed time and space to work through childhood drama without being pushed. And to have something to be good at. And Alma provided \"wisdom\", when needed (\"and now you know \\[what losing feels like\\], too.\")",

When I looked this up afterward, I was surprised that this was a real style in the sixties. The style doesn't really click for me even in real photos from the sixties so I don't know how to judge if her makeup is still intentionally bad even in context of the style.\n\nI'm confused at what the director intended the audience to take away from this makeup. It seems like a viewer that is familiar with the fashion of the time would see this as showing her caring about her appearance and being fashionable, while others who have never seen it before will think it's a bizarre mishap that portrays the exact opposite (and emphasizes how bad of a state she's in).\n\nIf you recognized the style immediately, did she do it correctly or did you still think she looked like a mess? Is the audience supposed to think that it looks bad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/430gc0zwuxi71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e610958a76cbc7cf916cef950ac418a5890927cd",

My sisters never did that particular eyeliner, they did wear fake hair (called falls), fake eye lashes and frosted lipsticks in shades like light pink.  \n\nBeth loved fashion and was just trying to emulate the  most elevated look.  Like I said, most regular girls just didn't take to this look.  Beth looks put of place and I think it was meant to showcase she didn't belong there anymore.

Even though exactly those things happened in real life, which makes it even more asounding that there is soo little in the book. And if I have one very very little critique of this otherwise mmindblowing adaptation is, that they put way too much emphasis on this cold war stuff, or at least leave way more room for these speculations, that the story, again: in my opinion, didn't need at all.",

I think it's safe to assume that he doesn't actually see her (she's in a dark room, he's out in the street with his car lights on), but that he just knows she's somewhere inside.

She developed a sense of where to push and when to defend. Her coach at school could take her only so far, but, at a tournament, she met an International Master and former national champion named Tong Yuanming, who taught chess in Shandong Province, a few hours north. Tong said that he would consider taking her on.  \n>  \n>He sat Hou at a board and had her face his top pupils, all boys. They had studied chess theory; they knew how to checkmate with only, say, a bishop and a knight. Hou did not know endgames, but she beat most of them anyway. She was seven years old.\n\nThe article also mentions the show/novel itself as well as the Polg\u00e1r sisters story. ",

        "text": "So I\u2019m watching the queens gambit for the first time and really enjoying it. It\u2019s a great show and I love Anya Taylor Joy\u2019s performance. However, I have a little issue after watching episode 3. At about 38:20, she moves her king 2 spaces and then she moves her rook from the right of the king (her right) to the left. I do not think this is allowed for several reasons. 1) Kings are only allowed to move 1 space at a time 2) you are only allowed 1 move per game and 3) pieces can\u2019t move through/over other pieces with the exception of the knight. Now I want to let you guys know that I only know the basics of chess and I don\u2019t play often. Maybe professional chess plays differently but I wouldn\u2019t have thought so. Also, I\u2019m only on episode 4 at the time of writing so maybe this gets explored later? I\u2019m not saying the character meant to cheat, maybe it was a mistake that no one picked up on and Beth lost so her cheating (whether accidental or purposeful) didn\u2019t cause her to win unfairly. I haven\u2019t seen anyone else asking about this and I haven\u2019t spotted any other mistakes like this although admittedly I haven\u2019t been looking very hard. It was just bothering me and I wanted to see if anyone else noticed and/or had an explanation.",

To make it work, though, would require a more versatile, wider-ranging performance from ATJ, the first season's story is done. \n\nWhether that happens is pretty much up to her, I would think. She's a hot property right now, if she were to be presented with a script and a production team she was really excited about and wanted to make her top priority, it would happen. I'm sure she has other projects she's excited about though, so I don't expect that for several years at least, if it happens at all.",

Because being a prodigy at something is not something everyone experiences, so it's a hard thing to personify some one who is so steadfast in their desire for one goal. I think another big struggle would probably be presenting Beth's loneliness as a character. Beth as a character has a chronic fear of being alone but at the same time struggles to let people in because of her fear of rejection. Anya Taylor-Joy summed it up best in the making of the Queen's Gambit documentary on Netflix (which I'd highly recommend) that it's not a physical loneliness Beth suffers from but an emotional one.",

                "comment_text": "For this specific role, the biggest struggle for ATJ was to not get lost in Beth. She said herself, she woke up some days feeling sad and didn't know why. Until she realized \"Beth\" was sad and it was \"her\" sadness she was just going through. She was under a lot of stress, physically and emotionally, when the work on TQG started so she did not have enough strength to put up a barrier between herself and Beth as a character. \n\nNow for \"creating\" Beth, it seems like there was no real struggle. She flew through the book in one take and immediately knew how she wanted Beth to be. How she would behave and react to things. \n\nI don't act, but I dabble a little in writing and maybe some of the struggles are similar there. You want to know as much about a character as possible. Where they come from, how they grew up, what food they hate, what their thoughts about a rainy day is. Like with an iceberg, you know so much more about the character than the audience will ever get to see. But it's there. It's in your head. Best case scenario, it guides the character. \n\nWith acting, I guess it influneces your facial expressions, your body language, your way of speaking. Subtly. The most fascinating with Anyas acting for me was how subtly and seamlessly she \"grew up\". From the slouching unsure kid/pawn to the extravagant and in the end confident and elegant queen. She knew through wigs and clothes and make up (or lack thereof), and also coaching most likely, exacly what \"age\" Beth was in the scene and what mannerisms sould be there in what intensity. \n\nAnd at that point, yeah, as the other answer said, the biggest struggle is how to transport what you know about the character and what is important for others to understand them.",

        "text": "Having seen Queen's Gambit an embarrassing five times, and having gone back now to read the book for the first time, I can't help but come to the conclusion that Scott Frank--as well received as he is--somehow remains vastly underappreciated/underrated. What he has done as the initiating vision and overarching director of this series is nothing short of shatteringly spectacular. The series not only stands on its own two feet, shining just as brightly as the source material, but it *exalts* the source material with its own dire excellence. \n\nScott Frank's original writing is a force unto itself. He doesn't NEED to adapt. His prowess as a writer is deeply formidable. Take GODLESS, for exampled. It's a 7-episode series on Netflix; a Western. There are points in the show that are so well written and performed that I had to pause and leave the room to decompress and process before continuing. I was 100 percent certain it was an adaptation, and I went to look up who the original author was... and was dumbfounded to learn that the author's name was Scott Frank. It's truly an extraordinary work of art. The only other show I can think of that even comes close to it in terms of feeling as if you're in the presence of literature is the first season of True Detective.\n\nMy point in all this is to say, the man understands what the heart of literature is, and what the heart of filmmaking is, and the way he weaves them together like two strands of DNA in the adaptation of the Queen's Gambit... it's like experiencing a new form of art to me. I've never had an experience like the one I had watching the Queen's Gambit. I've never been so penetrated emotionally and moved so profoundly, not just by the story or the performances, but by the ferocious and unyielding presence of greatness throughout the parameters of the execution; the camera work, the editing, the sound, the score, every last part of the engine was exploding like a well honed race car, but driven with such ultimate care, as if the race car was filled with sleeping infants. So much power commanded with such aching delicacy. What an absolute and overwhelming joy to experience. All I can say is I am now googling \"Scott Frank\" more than any other set of words in my life. Bravo! I can't wait to see what comes next.",

In basically any kind of story, the main character needs to overcome struggle.\n\nAnd the struggle with TQG was not the chess. Beth powered through her opponents easily (so easy that it has been a point of critique for some). Yes, Benny was a hurdle and yes Borgov was a brick wall. But that was external. The main struggle was internal; was with herself. not even alcohol and drugs, those were symptoms. She struggled with herself. With her inability to form (or recognize?) social connections. Her feeling of being misunderstood and rejected. Signs of being used (moreso in the book). She hated herself. But she overcame all that and in the end, she's at peace with herself and the world.\n\nSo a second season without that internal struggle would be boring. Having her have a fallback and re-doing the same internal struggle would be pointless and would frankly take a huge dump on the series we have and the book it's based on. A new struggle? yeah... maybe... but I don't see what else could have a similar impact. And there are so few examples of a good continuation without a source against so very many bad ones (Game of Thrones probably being the most \"infamous\" one of the last few years), that the chances of catching this kind of lightning in a bottle twice are just too small for me to even want to entertain the idea of it.\n\nSo yes, I would love \"more\" Beth. I think most of us would. But I also want her to stay in that happy place she reached at the end of this, surrounded by people she is finally able to love and that love her, for many many \"boring\" decades to go. But that wouldn't make for good TV. \\^\\_\\^;",

I think that the book was exploring the effects of sexual assault at a young age as you see her relationship with sex change. I thought that this was good and bad. I am enjoying the way that Tevis is exploring it but I also think that it is a better fit for book Beth and not show Beth. Just thought this was an interesting change from book to show. What are you all's thoughts?",

Jolene did try to force herself on Beth, and it was fairly descriptive (definitely wouldn't fly today), but what might be lost to some who read the book after seeing the movie, is that Jolene was only 12 during the \"forcing\". Although she's supposed to be that age in the film, she is played by a full-on adult, so our image of her is that of being a much-larger adult standing next to a tiny child Beth. In the book they both felt like kids.\n\nOther things to consider is that in the book, Jolene clearly had a crush on Beth, but was confused by it, and she was hurt by Beth rejecting her under the covers, and proceeded to insult Beth out of anger in the aftermath. But it was Beth who reached out to Jolene in a moment when she realized that Jolene was the only person in her life who she really loved, and this was when Beth was spiraling down the drain due to alcoholism, which was way more serious and dark in the book than in the show. In the show, Jolene is the one who seeks out Beth during this time, but in the book, Beth goes to great lengths to track down Jolene (including begging Ms. Deardorff for the contact info). And Jolene did a lot more for Beth's wellbeing in the book, including helping her kick her addictions and get into much better physical condition, which serves Beth well in Russia.",

EXCEPT the crush on Townes she obviously keeps till the end which becomes somewhat clear when she meets him again. The thing is that within their last get together in moscow she somewhat accepts that their friendship is only platonic. \n\nSomehow the end of the series left me with a bad feeling eventhough Beth seems to have won it all. But what instantly came to my mind, within the last scene, were 3 Quotes. The quote from her mother \"one day you're gonna be all allone\" and the question she asks Girev in the end of their match \"what are you going to do if you win the championship. What if you accomplish everything you wanted with only 24 years?\". Those were somehow answered by Harrys Prediction how he sees Beth as this one Player who was brilliant but then died early.\n\nActually I would have loved to have seen her feeling love for something else than chess in that series. Maybe that would also have made her appear less \"autistic\" and more human and empathic.\n\nThis way it only feels like she won the Match she always wanted to win, but in the same time died from the insight as she got everything she ever wanted. Everything she ever LOVED. And that is ONLY Chess.",

My main criticism of the book has always been that we were shown very little by way of consequences. Jolene was a bit snippy. That was about it. Then it was all forgotten about. Seemingly.

There was something depressing about how beyond him she really was, and on so many levels. Something about the chasm of difference, with her getting into a government protected Limo and him standing with the commoners watching her drive away... there was an undertow of bleakness to it that hit me like a bag of bricks. It's not that I felt bad for Townes, but in a way for her, because there's a kind of existential despair that comes with the idea that she'll never really be able to connect with anyone. \n\nThat's why, in the book, when Beth realizes she loves Jolene, you get this one thread of connection for Beth, this one person who ultimately matters to her, and it just explodes into your heart and soul. It's such a small thing; Tevis just barely graces over it with a single line, but it opens up the floodgates and, because of the trajectory of the story, it says so much about love; that it's the only real thing we bring to the table of the universe as humans, and it ties together her entire life in a meaningful way that we don't really get from the show. This is why you can only adapt ideas, you can't adapt literature.\n\nAlso the show merely coming to an end was depressing... because it was such an achievement, and the characters became like friends; it left a huge void in me because I was so immersed and invested that I wanted more in the worst way.",

In this case, while she's looking out the window, we can hear a clock ticking, and as the scene switches to Beth waiting on Harry the clock continues to tick, but is joined by the chess clock, which ticks in perfect unison with the previous scene's clock.

I think its mostly from people who didn\u2019t/have not read the book, they don\u2019t understand that that\u2019s how he\u2019s supposed to look like (aside from the thick mustache and pirate-ish get up, that was taken from a random book character, the Netflix version just merged them together) though how he dresses works as well cause it serves the same purpose, that he and Beth stood out from their own communities. Benny especially dressed to stand out from his peers. According from someone who read the book, his aesthetic in the book is more closer to a surfer, so the same purpose but different execution \n\nI don\u2019t really remember Maze Runner, i only watched the first one lol",

I think it's a grievous oversight, but that's just my opinion, as I was very moved by their respective performances. I thought Bill Camp gave a performance for the ages as Mr. Shaibel.\n2. I feel strongly that Anya's performance was not only the best in her category, but one of the finest performances I've seen in recent years, regardless of category, so I'm really hoping she wins this, as I think it's well deserved.\n3. If Thomas Brodie-Sangster had been snubbed I don't think I'd even be able to type right now. Really hoping he wins this. What a performance.\n4. The cinematography and editing were both so excellent that at points I wept just because of the beauty and the accomplishment. Truly superb. These are no-brainer wins imo.\n5. I felt the same way about the sound mixing and the score. There was some really gorgeous and subtle stuff going on; some of it was an actual display of genius imo.\n6. This is the first time in my life I've ever felt genuine giddy excitement for the Emmys; that's how much I loved The Queen's Gambit. :)\n7. Scott Frank is someone I can't stop googling now. His vision and leadership were just remarkable, given the overarching execution of the show. Looking forward to what he does next, and to going back and rediscovering some older work.",

Jeff Daniels won an Emmy for his turn as one of the best baddies of all time. It's dark! Also, it's not an adaptation; Scott Frank wrote it all by himself. And it murders.",

I've only really engaged with it as a technical thing prior to this; as a kind of engineering component to help sell the goods in any given moment. But in this context, with this level of talent, not just coming from Carlos but from the entire crew, it came across like a character unto itself, and at points it was so majestic that it made my heart ache. Really superb. I hope he wins, because he has so clearly gone above and beyond the craft to deliver something filled with whatever it is that makes some art immortal.",

        "text": "The Queens Gambit is an extraordinary work of fiction; it's so nuanced and realistic that many throughout the years have erroneously assumed that Beth Harmon was based on a real person. Further, people aren't aware that Walter Tevis has authored several other high profile works which have been successfully adapted. \n\nHere is his list of books and the adaptations, in order of publication:\n\n1. **The Hustler** (made into a film staring Paul Newman, which was nominated for nine Oscars, winning two of them). \n2. **The Man Who Fell to Earth** (made into a film starring David Bowie. It didn't win any awards but amassed a dedicated cult following and remains revered by fans of both sci fi and David Bowie). An amazing sci fi novel, described by crime author James Sallis thusly:  \"*The Man Who Fell to Earth* is among the finest science fiction novels. Just beneath the surface it might be read as a parable of the Fifties and of the Cold War. Beneath that as an evocation of existential loneliness, a Christian fable, a parable of the artist. Above all, perhaps, as the wisest, truest representation of alcoholism ever written.\"\n3. **Mockingbird** (yet to be adapted). A gorgeous sci fi novel about an android who has been alive for centuries and longs to experience death. \n4. **The Steps of the Sun** (yet to be adapted). Another sci fi novel. This one was largely rejected by Americans for positing that China would become the world's leading superpower (cough, cough).\n5. **The Queens Gambit** (Tevis has cited this to be his favorite, and claims that he wrote it as an \"ode to brainy women\").\n6. **The Color of Money --** the sequel to The Hustler. (The film adaptation starred Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. It was nominated for four Oscars, one of which was for Best Actor, won by Paul Newman). \n\nFrom Tevis's Wiki:\n\n\u2022 Tevis was a frequent smoker, gambler and alcoholic, and his works often included these vices as central themes.\n\n\u2022 His books have been translated into 18 languages.",

                "comment_text": "Only read The Queens Gambit and was pleasantly surprised how scene-ish he writes. Most scenes are 1:1 book to show. With other adaptations of other books, most of the time a \"scene\" in a book is much longer and in much more detail than what ends up in a movie or TV show. \n\nWhich is great (for the book), when it can describe the mood or the motivations of the characters in more depth. But in more than just a few cases authors go on tangets that are not relevant for the main story. They usually have so many ideas an character traits and just so much \"knowledge\" about their world and everyone in it and try to show that to the reader. \n\nTevis on the other hand (and again only from my experience with TQG) seems very focussed. Knows exactly what story beats are needed and cuts out anything that doesn't move the story foreward without being terse. Which is perfect for screenplays. \n\nSo his other books are definitely on my (ever growing) pile of \"to read\", with the intend to compare them to the movies then. Hoping the other two will get adapted, too.",

                "comment_text": "I am blown away by the capacity of Tevis to seamlessly weave multiple vantages, time frames, memories, facets into a single paragraph. On the surface, Beth is simply walking up the street, or laying in bed. But the entire world is coming into the picture, via memories, speculation, imagination, and the actual live world in the present moment. By way of example:\n\nScene: Beth walking home.\n\n>Walking home with the folded magazine tucked securely against her flat belly she thought again about that rook move Morphy hadn\u2019t made. The magazine said Morphy was \u201cperhaps the most brilliant player in the history of the game.\u201d The rook could come to bishop seven, and Black had better not take it with his knight because\u2026 She stopped, halfway down the block. A dog was barking somewhere, and across the street from her on a well-mowed lawn two small boys were loudly playing tag. After the second pawn moved to king knight five, then the remaining rook could slide over, and if the black player took the pawn, the bishop could uncover, and if he didn\u2019t\u2026 She closed her eyes. If he didn\u2019t capture it, Morphy could force a mate in two, starting with the bishop sacrificing itself with a check. If he did take it, the white pawn moved again, and then the bishop went the other way and there was nothing Black could do. There it was. One of the little boys across the street began crying. There was nothing Black could do. The game would be over in twenty-nine moves at least. The way it was in the book, it had taken Paul Morphy thirty-six moves to win. He hadn\u2019t seen the move with the rook. But she had. Overhead the sun shone in a blank blue sky. The dog continued barking. The child wailed. Beth walked slowly home and replayed the game. Her mind was as lucid as a perfect, stunning diamond.\n\nScene: Beth laying in bed\n\n>Sometimes chess would keep her awake at night for hours. It was like Methuen, except that she was more relaxed and not afraid of sleeplessness. She would lie on her mattress on the living-room floor after midnight with New York street noises coming in through the open bay window and study positions in her mind. They were as clear as they had ever been. She did not take tranquilizers, and that helped the clarity. It was not whole games now but particular situations\u2014positions called \u201ctheoretically important\u201d and \u201cwarranting close study.\u201d She lay there hearing the shouts of drunks in the street outside and mastered the intricacies of chess positions that were classic in their difficulty. Once during a lovers\u2019 quarrel where the woman kept shouting, \u201cI\u2019m at my fucking wit\u2019s end. At my wit\u2019s fucking end!\u201d and the man kept saying, \u201cLike your fucking sister,\u201d Beth lay on her cot and came to see a way of queening a pawn that she had never seen before. It was beautiful. It would work. She could use it. \u201cUp your ass,\u201d the woman shouted, and Beth lay back exulting and then fell pleasantly asleep.\n\nThe writing seems simple and straight forward, just \"tell what's happening\", but it's deceptively multifaceted and layered.",

Overhead the sun shone in a blank blue sky.\n\nThe word \"blank\" instead of \"clear\" removes \"the sky and the sun\" from Beth's mood in the midst of her discovery, rendering it no more or less relevant than the dog barking. By following her discovery with \"Overhead the sun shone...\", it gives us a hint that this is a moment of jubilation, but then it's taken away by the word \"blank\". The book is filled with these touches. It's really quite lovely and impressive.",

And to find out she never paid him, ouch.  \n\nThey do a flashback with Mr Sheibel and Young Beth with his \u201ctwo sides of every coin\u201d speech when she\u2019s in Mexico.  So he knew she would have a vice, he just didn\u2019t know what it would turn out to be when he made the speech.  \n\nIf you think that\u2019s bad, if you ever end up caring for somebody IRL and it turns out they are an addict, that\u2019s when the real pain hits because that\u2019s what happens to you.  Addiction sucked.  Once an addict, always an addict. They either find a way to somehow despite still being an addict, work around it eventually, or carry it for the rest of their life however long that may be.

Her alcoholism comes across as far more brutal and self-destructive. Jolene attempts to force herself sexually on Beth while in the orphanage, and Tevis doesn't pull back on the description of this event. When Beth fights her way out of it Jolene proceeds to be very insulting toward Beth in latter days. However, their friendship survives this, and it's Beth that seeks out Jolene as an adult in the book, not the other way around; we also get into Beth's head and learn that she really loves Jolene, perhaps more than anyone else in her life. So, yes, there are pockets that are lighter in the book, and you come away from reading it with a generally positive mood, but the overarching literate tapestry is definitively more dark. \n\nI think the most important difference is the prose of the author (Walter Tevis), which appears simple on the surface, but is deceptively multifaceted and layered, and it's not something that is adaptable into a film; it's pure literature. Tevis seamlessly weaves multiple vantages, time frames, memories, facets into a single paragraph, via memories, articles, speculation, imagination, all while maintaining the present reality, which in his hands is almost like a character unto itself. By way of example: \n\n>Walking home with the folded magazine tucked securely against her flat belly she thought again about that rook move Morphy hadn\u2019t made. The magazine said Morphy was \u201cperhaps the most brilliant player in the history of the game.\u201d The rook could come to bishop seven, and Black had better not take it with his knight because\u2026 She stopped, halfway down the block. A dog was barking somewhere, and across the street from her on a well-mowed lawn two small boys were loudly playing tag. After the second pawn moved to king knight five, then the remaining rook could slide over, and if the black player took the pawn, the bishop could uncover, and if he didn\u2019t\u2026 She closed her eyes. If he didn\u2019t capture it, Morphy could force a mate in two, starting with the bishop sacrificing itself with a check. If he did take it, the white pawn moved again, and then the bishop went the other way and there was nothing Black could do. There it was. One of the little boys across the street began crying. There was nothing Black could do. The game would be over in twenty-nine moves at least. The way it was in the book, it had taken Paul Morphy thirty-six moves to win. He hadn\u2019t seen the move with the rook. But she had. Overhead the sun shone in a blank blue sky. The dog continued barking. The child wailed. Beth walked slowly home and replayed the game. Her mind was as lucid as a perfect, stunning diamond.\n\nThe scene is simply: Beth walks home. But through an article in the magazine she is carrying (not reading, but already having skimmed) we delve into the distant past of the days of Morphy. Then we are brought into Beth's head as she realizes a mistake that Morphy made in the game. Around her children are playing their own game, and eventually one of them starts crying, so the world is changing and evolving around her as she walks. Upon her realization that Morphy not only made a mistake, but that she's very likely superior to him, we learn that the \"Sun is shining overhead\"; however, before we can claim this as a sign that Beth's mood is jubilant and not merely calculating, we are told that the sky is \"blank\" (not clear), rendering the sunny day as no more or less relevant than the barking dog. \n\nIt's brilliant and layered writing that masquerades as simple and straight-forward. You'll see instances of it as many times as you'll turn the pages of the book; he made it all look so easy. And it makes it all very much worth reading. \n\nThere are also some fairly major characterization differences, such as Benny is nothing like a pirate (though the pirate character that the Netflix Benny was partially culled from is in the novel, known only as \"chess bum\"; he shows up for a paragraph early on and we never hear from him again, or learn his name). Someone commented here that Cleo is not in the book, however she is, albeit only during the scene in Benny's apartment (not in France), and her name is \"Jenny\".  The twins, however, are altogether absent, and you'll discover that the majority of their dialog was taken directly from the book's narrative. In fact, any scene in the series where there is exposition (such as that of Beth narrating her loss to Benny for the benefit of her mother (which I thought was the only real mistake in the series; it would have been more powerful to experience the actors carrying the gravity of the moment with their facial expressions and body language, free from exposition) is generally taken straight from the novel's narrator. \n\nTLDR: if, after watching the show, you were left with a void in your soul because you wanted more, the novel is a GREAT way to fill that void. You will get lost in it; it's truly excellent and I highly recommend it.",

                "comment_text": "1. Garry Kasparov (former world chess champion, and former Soviet Union player) was a consultant on the show. He emphasized that, if the show wanted to be accurate for the times, \u201cSoviet champions traveling in the \u201960s in the West with their family, they must be accompanied by KGB guys\u201d. (Source: https://slate.com/culture/2020/11/queens-gambit-garry-kasparov-interview-netflix-chess-adviser.html). So I think your question has an ungrounded assumption \u2014 it\u2019s not important for the plot, but important for the realism of the world being created in the show :) \n\n2. That chess players travel with their family is not wholly unusual \u2014 even today! It\u2019s obviously more common for players who are children, but consider Borgov\u2019s situation. He\u2019s being set up in some of the nicest hotels in some of the worlds most beautiful cities. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want to share that with his family, and that his family would enjoy tagging along (kind of like how Alma seemed to enjoy traveling with Beth as well). Also, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d miss his family while away, so why wouldn\u2019t he also want them to come? \n\nAs for mortal danger, I suspect this will be up to interpretation since there\u2019s not hard evidence given by the show. But I personally doubt he was in mortal danger. The simplest reason to think he would be in such danger is if you assume the USSR government would be ruthlessly murderous to their chess playing champions, which cuts against the generally positive attitude that the show takes towards the USSR. Beth, for example, seems to reject the narrative of \u201csoviets = godless commies\u201d as was held by the Christian folks who almost underwrote her trip. Thus, I think to interpret Borgov as being in danger suggests an interpretation of the USSR that\u2019s thematically off.\n\n3. Another comment talked about the potential disappointment Borgov felt as a competitor about Beth being hungover since a victory over a hungover player is a hollow one. I think there\u2019s truth to this, but that there\u2019s more to Borgov\u2019s response. \n\nRecall what Borgov said about Beth in Mexico City: \u201cShe\u2019s an orphan. A survivor. She\u2019s like us \u2014 losing is not an option for her. Otherwise, what would her life be?\u201d. What\u2019s important for the analysis is that he says \u201cshe\u2019s like us\u201d. Borgov is displaying a camaraderie with Beth here, he sees and recognizes her as someone like himself. Perhaps this stems from a recognition that they have so much more in common as elite chess players \u2014 commonalities that very few other people in the world would understand. Regardless of the reason why, if Borgov does feel some kind of camaraderie for her, then it\u2019s not super surprising that he\u2019d be concerned. We all are concerned for the welfare of people we have a camaraderie with \u2014 that\u2019s part of what it means to feel camaraderie for them at all.\n\nAlso, we can feel empathy for people who are struggling, even if they are strangers. It\u2019s possible that Borgov is concerned just because it\u2019s concerning to see someone suffer from alcoholism, even if they are not someone we are close with.\n\n4. The gun thing, I suspect, is again in line with maintaining realism for 1960s US-USSR relations. It was a tense time. \n\nAs for the redhead comment, I suspect that\u2019s a version of \u201clocker room talk\u201d. It\u2019s usually strange to talk about someone in the third person while they are present, unless you assume that they can\u2019t understand you. The comments are made in Russian between the driver and the agent, while Beth is in the car. I suspect they assumed Beth didn\u2019t know Russian, so they\u2019re commenting about her while she\u2019s there and assuming she can\u2019t understand. Now, what\u2019s something that two straight men might discuss privately when they both see an attractive woman? Naturally, how attractive said woman is. But instead of \u201cshe\u2019s hot.\u201d \u201cEspecially if you like redheads\u201d, the dialogue is a bit more sophisticated \u2014 it\u2019d be a rather boring script line if it was just something like \u201cshe\u2019s hot\u201d after all. And there\u2019s also thematic overtones; obviously fashion and aesthetics is something Beth cares about, and we even see her style her hair in a way that a magazine suggests is stylish when she\u2019s in Kentucky. Comparing her to a movie star emphasizes some of the ways that Beth has come into her own, as recognized by those around her.\n\nGreat questions! Definitely let me know if you disagree or have other thoughts / questions! :)",

The only thing I would add is regarding Beth seeing Borgov at the zoo.  \n\n- Matt and Mike joking with Beth that Borgov is a robot.

How cool is that \n\n- Beth hearing in the elevator the Russians saying Beth is a drunk. And when she sees Borgov, she immediately looks at her glass of beer in disgust. \n\n- The flashback (when she\u2019s walking with the beer) back to a conversation we had not heard between Beth and Mr Sheibel \u201cthere\u2019s two sides to every coin\u2026.\u201d   In that conversation Mr. Scheibel says something that I didn\u2019t pick up on up to that point in the series where he says \u201cyou have so much anger in you\u201d.   That whole zoo scene and flashback set us up for later in the series when it\u2019s all falling apart.  Like At the end of the 6th episode in her nasty exchange with Harry where\u2019s he\u2019s being polite but speaking from the heart and she\u2019s trying to put him down.  \u201cyou were supposed to go to college, not work in a grocery store\u201d.  \u201cYeah , I do both and I like it there. They are good people\u201d\u2026 the look of \u201chuh?\u201d on her face as she couldn\u2019t even process that was even a possibility.",

A lot of spy vs spy stuff. \n\nWater: Borgov had already heard that Beth had a drinking problem. One great aspect of this show is that the minimalist dialogue leaves a lot of room for different interpretation, but my personal take is that he could see Beth was hung over, and he was disappointed on her behalf. And disappointed that she wouldn\u2019t present a real challenge to him in that condition.\n\n(Not that he wanted to lose\u2014just a sportsmanship thing. It wasn\u2019t a fair fight, like winning versus an injured opponent.)",

For example, after Beth won the Cincinnati tournament she thought to herself (before Alma had said anything) she should probably offer Alma half of the winnings. She subsequently decided against it because \u201cshe liked her money\u201d and SHE had earned it. I\u2019m not saying that is why Beth didn\u2019t pay Mr. Shaibel back the promised $10. \n\nI\u2019ve always explained it to myself from the perspective that $10 in the 60s was equivalent to $100 (or more) these days. A hundred dollars might have been a lot of money for Mr. Shaibel on a janitor\u2019s salary so maybe he took up a collection from the chess club that he and Mr. Ganz belonged to. If he did that, he wouldn\u2019t really have felt the loss.\n\nEdit:  grammar correction",

The KY Tournament date was Oct 20-22, 1963. That gave them two months to do all those other tournaments before Houston at X-Mas. That's much better than the TG date would have been. (It was TG in the book)\n2. The tournament  format was 50 moves/2 hours. It was limited to State Residents and \"bona fide\" members of state clubs. I don't know why later on the film had Annette Packer saying the rounds were 90 minutes per player and intimating a sudden death format but that certainly appears to not be the original plan but rather a last minute change and screw-up.\n\nInterestingly in the notice it doesn't refer to the Tournament as either being Open or Closed. That detail was added later. In the real World the was no State Open tournament for nearly 30 years after the one depicted, only closed. Beth's tournament had to be open or she couldn't have entered since she didn't have a rating.",

Possibly because it kept Beth away from scrutiny for almost all of the first day. Anyway after 3 rounds a very few of the top players in the lower bracket of the tournament moved up to play rated players. Beth played a guy who iirc, was about 1600 as the last game on day one.\n\nAnyway 4 rounds on day one per the Chess Magazine's time control of 120/50,  is im-frigging-possible. A time control of 120/50 requires start times 4 hours apart (120x2). 4 Rounds of that with the printed start time  of 2 pm for round one has the last round of day one starting at 2 am and that's with no breaks which is of course, non-sensical.\n\nTo cover up the discrepancy between the magazine and the actual tournament  they didn't mention the start time and shortened the maximum length of the rounds by an hour each. If you start at 8 or 9  am and go with the shortened rounds I think it would work, but just barely.",

The Swiss System is where you get 1 point for win, half a point for a draw, no points for a loss & the most points win. In this case the 2 top point totals played for the championship so it was slightly modified. \n\nThe 3 rounds part however makes no sense as that' number is supposed to be the total number of rounds which we know was 7 plus the final.

Another example from that magazine is that the Russian tournament clipping is the actual article. They don't doctor it by adding Luchenko, Laev, Borgov, Girev, etc.  All the articles we see and the cover aren't even from the same issue; they were pieced together.  The writers of the show changed some of the other book details which ended up making them false (Morphy's sacrifice, Marshall Attack, Nona didn't play men, etc.) I appreciate that Tevis used actual player names, openings, and tournaments to add some realism to the story, but there comes a point where the details will be inaccurate.

In my mind, since Borgov was revered so much throughout the series, I would say that he would be in the mid-2700's, seeing as how ahead of the curve he was relative to the other players of the era (kinda similar to Karpov, both in their styles and complete dominance).\n\nFor Beth, I cannot imagine that her elo was anything below 2700 after the tournament in episode 7. Going on a 6-0 win streak against 6 people who were almost certainly high rated than her would definitely yield a significant amount of points. For Benny, it would be harder to say, as we don't really have much to base it off of other than that he was the US champion until Beth came along (correct me if I'm wrong). That, in my opinion, puts him at least in the high-tier GM category. Comparing him to other players of the era, I would say that his official rating would be in the mid 2600's.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

The only thing holding her back from a higher rating was lack of international tournament games. The show makes it look like she beat everyone except the losses to Benny and Borgov with no draws. The book said she had draws and a couple of losses sprinkled in but not often. \n\nOn the second note, it\u2019s implied after the tournament she would go to the candidates qualifier and contend for the title in 1969.",

But considering Benny's game maybe didn't translate so well to the international scene (as seen he didn't play many high level games outside the US), I could place Benny at maybe low 2700 who occasionally rose to 2780. Sort of like a stronger version of Naroditsky.\n\nBorgov is the WC at that point. He's a super GM. He's considered the best having beaten guys like Luchenko. I can see him easily at high 2700 (maybe 2780-85), and maybe a peak of 2850. This is in comparison to other long reigning WCs. \n\nBeth is a prodigy. She's lost only to Benny and Borgov, and firmly beats both of them later on.  The only thing not making her a GM is not having any norms. She could easily be sitting at 2800 consistently and peak like Carlsen (2882). \nShe goes 6-0 with convincing wins in a very strong tournament. If you want a comparison to this, Fabiano Caruana went on a 7-0 run against the likes of Carlsen (rated an absurd 2877), Nakamura, MVL etc. in the Sinquefeld Cup 2014. At that point, the computer pegged his play at a 3600 level.",

Beth doesn't have engines to study with, so her accuracy can only be so high. I'd place Beth's end of series strength as mid-high 2700's for sure. \n\nIf she's able to defeat the World Champion in a classical game and sweep the Soviet field at the peak of their power, 2700 is right around that skill level. Bobby Fischer peaked at like 2770. \n\nSo essentially she's a genius for her time, and would be considered a super-grandmaster top 10 player even today.",

The world champions of the 50s were never that strong, as far as I know.\n\nBeth was new at the scene, just got her first win against Borgov in a single game -- she can't have been that close in rating yet. She would only get close after many more tournaments. Even Kasparov, when he qualified for the WC match by beating Korchnoi and Petrosian in matches (so further along than Beth was), was rated 2690 or so at the time.\n\nI feel that Benny, as a US champion who was not Fischer, was not close to the Soviet grandmasters but a tier or two below.\n\nSo I would think something like Borgov 2640, Beth 2570, Benny 2520.",

Its quite easy to assume Borgov would have a rating of low-mid 2700's considering that. Beth should have similar strength and would definitely surpass this rating eventually in a few years and reach around 2750.\n\nShe'd be close to Fischer's rating (literally only 20-30 points below) and she played in the same era as him.\n\nYou are the one heavily underestimating hers and Borgov's rating. (Well, not that I blame you since you think \"Spassky literally don't exist in the show\", which shows you don't have much knowledge about the verse or just don't remember well enough to scale it)",

Nf3 d6\n3. d4 cxd4\n4. Nxd4 Nf6\n5. Nc3 g6\n6. f4\n\nHowever, Beth responds with \u201cP to B4\u201d as well, which is obviously an illegal move cus the f pawn is blocked by her Knight on f6. The c pawn doesn\u2019t make sense either cus she doesn\u2019t have her c pawn anymore. \n\nCan another person confirm that this is something the show got wrong? If not, I\u2019d like to clear my confusion up. Just for the sake of my sanity. \n\nThanks \nxoxo",

I actually think this is a very compelling question, and I agree with you, the scene felt like it flew intentionally in the face of physics; not unlike the plane in LOST crashing. I don't agree with the other commenter that you're overthinking it; instead I think you're onto something. I do not think that \"something\" is an alternate universe, however.\n\nHere's my two cents:\n\nI think the intention was to show us something very theatric, even dreamlike, so that we don't know for sure whether it's real or something from Beth's memory; but more importantly, I think the impossibility of the scene serves as an allegory of the impossibility of Beth growing up to be a chess master in the fifties/sixties. To quote Mr. Schaibel: \"girls don't play chess\". Well what about a girl whose mother was a published mathematician who went insane, ended up crushed under the oncoming car that she intentionally swerved into, thereby delivering her daughter to an orphanage where the custodian is a chess master?",

I mean it all flew in the face of realism; it was clearly by design. The question that I hear the OP asking, really, is what were the intentions of the showrunner with this setup?",

If this was the intention, then i am fine with it and your analysis is spot on as far as I am concerned. I'm not sure if that was the intention but let's hope so! And I agree I do tend to over think things. I was watching a show the other day set in the mid to late 70's. The actor was talking about a piece of equipment he had just purchased - BUT that particular piece of equipment didn't even come out until the early 80's - It was a decent show but that right there ruined the whole thing for me!

If you know those things counters are very feasible. So because of her memory Beth was able to analyze those games with Benny, determine his playing style(s), develop counters, and analyze her own game for weaknesses.  That said the short time between the two speed chess events is somewhat remarkable. It implies that at its root speed chess is a much much simpler game than regular chess.",

I now think she was already better than Benny at the US Championship so he hustled her with some New York street chess tricks to rattle her. Just like she learned how to beat Shaibel, she thought and improved her speed game by playing in her head to get past the tricks. \n\nI have been rewatching the show as I make videos about QG on my YouTube channel. I just released a video today on episode 6 which is why I was thinking about this. Here is link if interested https://youtu.be/4Exs3y8A7dM. Enjoy.",

Since it was at - lets call it grandmaster level - we typically became friends and ended up playing a lot.\n\nThat's just how it is when you're really fucking good at something.",

She says she and what\u2019s his face got hitched right after graduation, and that the baby followed soon after. (I think the implication is that she got knocked up before they graduated, and I\u2019m making a possible leap that they do mean high school and not college.)\n\nBut in this scene, the baby is still \u2026 a baby, not a toddler, implying that \u201cgraduation\u201d wasn\u2019t that long ago.\n\nHow old is Beth supposed to be right after Alma\u2019s death? Did she graduate high school?\n\nAlso, at one point Beth mentions that Benny was born in 1940 (referencing him being 8 in 1948). So I guess he\u2019s a lot older than Beth than I realized.\n\nI think, in short, I assumed Beth was much older in the back half of the series than she really is.",

When he invited her to his room in Las Vegas she expected something more intimate to happen between them. (In the book while they played chess together all she wanted was to make love with him). But then Townes' boyfriend walked in and Beth was immediately crushed. When she was leaving Vegas they saw each other again and Townes said sorry about her loss with Benny, but Beth on the other hand expected him to say something about their relationship. (That's why when Townes said sorry, she asked why and Townes said about her loss with Benny and she immediately said \"Give my best to Roger\" and quickly got in the car and left Townes behind). I think she broke his heart by not giving him a chance to explain in that moment and quickly left instead. \n\nTownes seemed to be in love with her because he was figuring out his sexuality. I mean c'mon Beth's charm and wit and everything, everyone should be mesmerized by her. \n\nI think Beth is a pretty straight forward person, when she realized her relationship with Townes would go nowhere she stopped it immediately. With Harry too I mean she would make it clear that she was not interested in being in a relationship with him (she cut him off when he was trying to confess, ignored him after sex,...). With Benny, there was attraction at first but she was upset when he talked about chess right after they had sex, took that as a signal that there wouldn't be anything more than that between them and moved on immediately (that's why when they called and Benny said he missed her, she said nothing cuz she was already over it). \n\nBeth being in love with Townes after all those years is quite a beautiful detail to me cause he was the first person she ever felt connection and attraction towards. In Beth's eyes Townes was the most dazzling and also extremely caring at the same time but he at the end of the day only saw them as friends.",

The show really leaves room for interpretation, as the ending and conclusion to their relationship is not something that's presented as much as it is felt. So you really gotta read the room.

Because he began to wonder if he was actually gay or bi.  \n\nBut as I said in another response, you can have strong feelings for someone of the opposite sex without wanting to have sex with them.\n\nTo be honest, I've had such feelings for a couple women in my life.  But people - even in 2021 - still think \"guy liking girl equals he wants to have sex with her\"",

Townes doesn't even occur anymore in the book after their encounter in the hotel room. \n\nWhich is okay. As I said, this is Beths story. Front and center.

I suspect this is what Alice Harmon drops, for a few reasons:\n\n1. \u201cWhat I understand is you\u2019re not taking care of yourself\u201d is what Beth\u2019s father says to Alice. \u201cTaking care\u201d could of course refer to a lot of things, but one might be to her mental health. We have reason to think this is what\u2019s being referenced since Beth herself later tells Jolene that Alice went crazy. And it\u2019s not surprising to think pills would be handed out to treat mental illness.\n\n2. When Beth\u2019s dad hands the object to Alice, it sounds like a vial of pills. Listen closely at 12:08-12:09.\n\n3. It looks like Alice is holding a vial of pills when she receives the object from Beth\u2019s dad. Look closely at her left hand at 12:11.\n\nNow of course you might be wondering what those pills are exactly. To this I think we can only speculate, but I\u2019d wager they\u2019re something similar to the half dark green, half light green pills that Beth gets addicted to (Xanzolam). Again if you pause at the 12:14/12:15 mark, you can see that the pills in the vial Alice drops are half dark green and half white (maybe they\u2019re also half light green, but it looks white to me. Up to interpretation!). That\u2019s a relatively distinctive look, which makes me think their similar pills.",

If you have the time, I would love for some help!\n\nI have to do a reader-response analysis, comparing peoples view of the scenes.\n\nMy point is to see if the viewer feels stressed because of what\u2019s shown visually. You can watch the scenes without sound to know for sure. A picture says more than a thousand words, right? Whatever you feel made you stressed in any way, is of great help. The editing, camera movements or maybe lighting. Whatever it is, I\u2019ll take it. And if you didn\u2019t feel stressed or impacted, let me know too! Everything helps!\n\nThe four scenes are:\n\nEpisode 1: 53 minutes in to 56:30. The scene where Beth and all the pills land on the floor.\n\nEpisode 3: 36 minutes in to 41 minutes. The US open-scene against Benny Watts\n\nEpisode 5: 29:50 minutes in to 31:40 minutes. The US championship in Ohio.\n\nEpisode 6: 29:11 minutes in to 33:30 minutes.

At least I had to include the text itself in the appendix, and I gave data on the number of answers altogether, and also when I broke it down to questions and when there were similar ones, I gave the exact number there too. It's just a suggestion. So I'd make a questionnaire (with the videos cut! even then most people probably won't take the effort to watch it) and share it again in the group.",

                "comment_text": "Okay, so two things, one kind of bad news and one potentially good news:\n\n1. There is no way by asking people in this subreddit that you will get enough responses or any responses to be able to analyze the data in roughly one week.\n2. What you can do, however, is search this subreddit for posts and comments about specific scenes. I am sure you can dig up a decent amount of content on people's takes on the first episode ending with the giant bottle of pills, but maybe not so much the others. If you have already written in length about the others, I still suggest you ditch them. Ultimately, focusing on scenes where many more people have left their thoughts will give you more data and will make writing about the new scenes much easier anyway. I recommend looking into some of the following scenes:\n\n* When Cleo comes to Paris and ends up getting Beth completely hammered the night before her match against Borgov. TONS of posts about this.\n* When Townes invites Beth into his hotel room to take photos of her for the newspaper, and things get a bit sexually/romantically tense, and then the man who is clearly Townes' lover briefly enters and then leaves the scene. Lots and lots of posts about this.\n* Beth's total breakdown/bender where she ends up passed out on the floor after her whole drunk-dancing to \"Venus\" scene. People have discussed the portrayal of her addiction, etc. a lot with regard to this scene.\n* All of Beth's American chess \"friends\" and supporters on the phone with her during the adjournment with Borgov in Russia. Lots of posts on here about it.\n* When Beth goes to Mr. Shaibel's funeral and then returns to the orphanage, goes into his office, sees how he kept the photo of them and kept up with her chess career through the newspapers, and then cries in Jolene's car. Definitely a popular post here.\n* The Beth & Benny sex scene. People have posted about this A LOT.\n* Beth distracting the young Russian player by making a move and then suggestively dancing away - people have a lot of different opinions on this and it's been asked a lot before.\n\nIf you just need four scenes, go through the subreddit (search within the sub) and see which ones have the most posts/comments. Then, collect all of the comments by hand (just copy them and paste them into a word document), separating each scene you're focusing on into a different document so you can more easily analyze people's responses separately. Seriously, collect all the comments that are relevant. Then, once you have fully exhausted your search of the subreddit, go to your documents and weed out any comments that do not at all touch on a visual aspect of the scene - but do not delete comments that allude to it but are not explicit. Many things about the visual aspects may be implicit - honestly, that depends on the scenes you choose as well.\n\nOnce you have \"cleaned\" your data, go through each document separately, one at a time, and \"code\" posts/comments for different broad themes you may have in mind already, using the \"insert comment\" function on Word. Then, when you want to quickly identify how many times a certain theme exists in the data, just search your \"theme\" comment, selecting \"search comments only\" (in the side bar), and it will give you an exact count, and will also allow you to quickly find commentary you'd like to include as data to represent a specific theme. Do this for each scene you choose.\n\nI know it's just an undergrad thesis and it would be nice to just, say, collect the first ten comments on each scene that alludes to the visual aspects of the scene, and not go through everything, but then you can't defend your data against serious bias because perhaps more recent or top comments may, for some reason (think unspecified variable you can't control for, and you really don't want to deal with that if you're a statistician) systematically vary from the general average. Of course, there will always be some bias in research, since you may miss a comment, etc., but do be thorough.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work, but I have done content analysis research very successfully like this for a while now (think papers published in respected academic journals), and once you get rolling, especially once you've gathered your data in a document, you really do just get sort of sucked into it and it goes quickly. Plus, I am sure you can keep your main themes of interest quite simple and broad - no need to do focused or structured coding for an undergrad thesis that also is very very very close to being due. Also, this subreddit is active, but not NEARLY as active as a lot of other subs, plus it's a relatively new subreddit, so it's unlikely you will be completely inundated with relevant commentary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really, really urge you to take my advice. If you do it right, your thesis will be great. But please do not put any more effort into asking people their reactions to the visual aspects of very specific scenes, because if you do, you will not finish your thesis. I know that sounds harsh, but that is what I would tell any student I mentor who came to me in this situation.\n\nedit: typo",

                "comment_text": "Well, I'll try to give a few ideas, hope it helps.\n\nFirst off, idk how familiar you are with questionnaires, but according to my experience (I have a BA degree, studying at an MA level, and I've completed tons of questionnaires for others too), you should start with a page about data: this can contain gender, age, level of studies so far, etc. so that you can analyse data paired with different target groups. As another comment suggested, you might wanna decide on a target group too, but I'm not sure if you have enough time for that. Important question here - at least I think so: \"have you seen Queen's Gambit before?\". If you have a facebook profile or anything else on social media, I suggest you share the questionnaire there, because here on this subreddit you're obviously gonna get results from those who have seen the series. Well, except if your target group is this audience, then it's fine. But I think if you want genuine, non-biased experiences from the participants (e.g. them knowing the ending, the background of certain characters, etc. might help but might also hinder your research), then you're better off sharing it with people who don't know the series. Using both audiences might lead you to best results imo, because then you can see both sides, if you have enough answers.\n\nAs for questions, you can decide on what to look at. Maybe don't be afraid of them being too straightforward; I used analyses of literary excerpts in my thesis that I thought were fairly obvious, but many people had different opinions than me, they had another POV. Anyway, yes, you can give questions of whether they agree to certain things. That's easiest. If they have to give lengthy answers, they'll get bored or tired of it. I'd definitely use questions with something like:\n\n* 1-5\n* definitely disagree, mostly disagree, slightly disagree, neutral / don't know, slightly agree, mostly agree, definitely agree\n* or if you wanna omit neutral answers, give like, 1-4\n\nThese can be, e.g.:\n\n* Does this scene induce fear in you?\n* Does this scene induce excitement in you?\n* Does this scene make you feel stressed? --> and here, you can ask them to describe in a few words both on an emotional and physical level, what they feel. E.g. increased heart rate, feeling the need to cry - for physical. For emotional - embarrassment, pity, discomfort, etc. You could also list these feelings and ask them to tick the boxes for what they feel or give a yes/no answer for them.\n\nBut you can also ask them to describe in 1-2 sentences e.g. how they felt about a certain character who was meant to provoke some feeling in the audience in your opinion. Whether watching the chess game is intense for them or boring. Connected to that, you can ask them to describe their level of knowledge in chess, because this can also affect the quality of their experience. You can ask them how they feel about Beth's mother also, whether they think she seemed in need of help, or whether she was irresponsible. Whether they blame her or feel for her.\n\nThat's all I could think of rn. I'm no expert, it's just how I'd do it. Hope it helps!\n\nEDIT: You might wanna choose just two scenes maybe. I was too ambitious with my thesis as well, and I ended up with less answers than I could have. So if it's not extremely necessary, I'd just choose the most important scenes. But you might need them, it depends on your research, so you should decide.",

Brainstorm them, and then pick the one that interests you most.\n\nSecond, what do you want to say about this theme in relation to the novel? This is your position, and a concise one sentence statement of this will be your thesis.\n\nThree, what\u2019s your argument that establishes this thesis? This will take exegetical work. What in the show will help defend the premises of your argument, and build up to defending your position?\n\nFour, what\u2019s a way that someone can object to you? How might someone with a different view or interpretation push back?\n\nFive, what\u2019s your response to your objector? What makes your argument better than theirs?\n\nHere\u2019s an example but using a different story, say The Sun Also Rises. Maybe I want to explore the theme of masculinity in the novel: I\u2019ll argue that Hemingway portrays the lost generation as having abandoned traditional conceptions of manhood. I\u2019ll argue for this by pointing out how Jake\u2019s impotence \u2014 which is straightforwardly related to masculinity \u2014 makes him unviable as a partner to the women he loves, Lady Brett Ashley. Maybe I can interpret Jake\u2019s impotence as a loss of his traditional masculinity. I might also point out how Brett, a woman, seems to dominate all the men in her life. This definitely is some subversion of traditional masculinity. Then there\u2019s also something to be said of how Romero is the one who seduces Brett, very similarly to how he dominates the bulls he fights. How Hemingway seems to glorify this traditionally very manly activity, and how he depicts the bullfighter being successful in amorous affairs that Jake isn\u2019t, might suggest something about masculinity also. \n\nObviously this example is vague \u2014 the thesis should be more specific, and the arguments should be crisper, and I didn\u2019t consider an objection / reply. But this should help you get started!",

Next scene, If you recall, Beth was in a bathtub filled with water wearing the same cloths when she woke up. Cleo was in the bed alone.\nWith this in mind, any one of the following could have happened:\n1. Cleo hooked up with both dudes and Beth isolated herself and passed out in the bath. Possibly to try to sober up. Didn\u2019t want to be naked because them two dudes were primed. This is possible. \n2. Cleo hooked up with one dude. The other tried with Beth and she didn\u2019t want to. Isolating in the bathroom.  Wife has a theory that those two dudes were sent to derail Beth the night before the match\n3. Cleo and Beth went back to the room together. Cleo was game and Beth was not. So she went in the bathroom to get away from Cleo. \n4. Cleo and Beth went back to the room. Nothing happened with the two dudes. Nothing happened between Beth and Cleo. They kept drinking in the room. Beth went in the bath to try to sober up because she was drunk and had a match the next day. Left her clothes on. \n5. They hooked up and then Beth left the delicacy of Cleo to take a bath in her cloths. This theory\nseems less likely.",

There's a section of the book when she's on her way to Moscow and she's thinking about how much she wishes Benny was with her: (this took me way too long to find)\n\n\"What she really needed was Benny Watts here with her. If she hadn't been such a fool, giving back that money, taking a stand on something she hadn't really cared about. That wasn't so. It wasn't being an asshole to refuse to be bullied, to call that woman's bluff. But she needed Benny. For a moment she let herself imagine traveling with D.L. Townes, the two of them staying together in Moscow. But that was no good. She missed Benny, not Townes. She missed Benny's quick and sober mind, his judgment and tenacity, his knowledge of chess and his knowledge of her. He would be in the seat beside her, and they would talk chess, and in Moscow after her games they would analyze the play and then plan for the next opponent. They would eat their meals together in the hotel, the way she had done with Mrs. Wheatley. They could see Moscow, and whenever they wanted to they could make love at their hotel. But Benny was in New York, and she was in a dark airplane...\"",

I totally get that it\u2019s Beth\u2019s story and her relationships with the men in her life are not supposed to be the focus of the story but Beth and Benny have one of the most interesting dynamics in the book because they\u2019re essentially mirrored images of each other. Like how they both appear to have addiction problems. There\u2019s even a short exchange they cut out where they both admit to being emotionally closed off. Even if you don\u2019t think they\u2019re in love (though Benny absolutely falls for her), I genuinely think they missed out on some really intriguing character writing, especially in regards to Beth, by not focusing on them and their similarities for at least a little bit longer.",

You can can tell who has the advantage or what would be the best play from the point we're shown but that's about it. \n\nAs it was mentioned here, the games were taken from actual chess games so it's possible to look it up and check the \"game\" and how characters \"played\" based on the result, I guess, but, imo, that kinda defeats the point of analysing *show* games.\n\nThe games best followed are those with the giant chess board for audience but even there you have a *lot of* time skips. My biggest gripe in the game is the huge chess *tell, don't show* where they comment on character's strategies without actually showing the board or pieces positions at all. Especially the last Borgov game. I **wanted** to know how or why he's playing differently than he should. Is he trying to confuse the opponent by playing slightly worse ? Does he actually have a better strategy than they thought of? If you're going to tell us that something wasn't happening then I really wanna know what **was** supposed to happen and **why** it didn't.\n\nBasically, if you go out of your way to analyse the games this show is using, yes, you can do that and there are many videos connecting show games to rl games and commenting on them. But if you just want to freeze frame and go from your own analysis, it's virtually impossible. It's like summarising a book when you open at 5 random pages and read one line.",

Beth ends up stealing a bottle of alcohol from the man\u2019s liquor tray, leaving the house with no one the wiser, then going home and visualizing chess on the ceiling aided by the pills and stolen alcohol.\n\nThe meaning of this, I think, is to emphasize Beth\u2019s loneliness and addiction. When she\u2019s talking with the other girls earlier in the scene, it\u2019s painfully obvious that she doesn\u2019t fit in with them. She doesn\u2019t know the music they like (You\u2019re the One by The Vogues), doesn\u2019t pick up on their innuendo (\u201ctrading rooks\u201d), etc. She leaves the room by saying \u201cI\u2019m going to use the bathroom\u201d \u2014 but no one even notices her go. When she eventually leaves the house, again no one notices her go. This, I think, does some work to emphasize her loneliness. The stealing of the alcohol, and that she pops the pills + drinks the alcohol, emphasizes her addiction.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Beth at the classmates house vs. Beth at home also drives home a point about her character, at this time. She feels really alienated from those around her, and she only feels at home with chess. \n\nOn 2, we\u2019re in agreement! I also think Benny wanted her to be focused on chess.",

Of note is that after Beth and Harry have sex, Beth starts reading a chess book and ignores the serious love connection. After Beth and Benny have sex, Benny starts talking about chess first and does the same to Beth as she did to Harry. I think it shows that Benny was even more focused on chess than Beth was.",

It pinpoints the progression of her addiction, and it does so in the midst of what is *portrayed* as the \"perfect, beautiful home\", the classic dad figure reading the paper (although he's obviously totally tuned out).  Later, of course, we also learn that the mean girl eventually ends up on the sad side of life, so the beautiful home with the dad reading the paper wasn't so perfect after all.",

I wish Rivera would do more (3 scores since 2014 by the age of 50, all for Scott Frank), but I guess he's just too happy teaching composition at the Frost School of Music, one of the finest such establishments.\nhttps://people.miami.edu/profile/riveramusic@miami.edu\nRivera frequently uses ostinato patterns in the score, which seems logical in a story focused on addictions and obsessions.

        "text": " \n\n[Video for Ruy L\u00f3pez Trap with COMMENTARY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAJJu_xC3B4)\n\nThe most entertaining yet educational video you can find, explaining in detail the stickiest opening of all time, the Ruy L\u00f3pez. The video features traps from the Mortimer, to beginner ones like the Fishing Pole. See below for an in-depth transcript. Please subscribe and hit the notification bell for more great chess content. If you enjoyed this video, please press the like button. It'll be greatly appreciated.\n\nMortimer Trap: The Mortimer Trap is a chess opening trap in the Ruy Lopez named after James Mortimer. The Mortimer Trap is a true trap in the sense that Black deliberately plays an inferior move to tempt White into making a mistake.\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 The trap begins with Black playing the Berlin Defense to the Ruy Lopez.\n2. d3 White plays a quiet alternative to the more common 4.0-0, 4.d4, or 4.Nc3 (the last would transpose to the Four Knights Game).\n\n4... Ne7 The Mortimer Defense, intending to reroute the knight to g6. This rare move loses time and thus is inferior to other moves, but it sets a trap. White has many acceptable replies, but the tempting capture of the black pawn on e5 is a mistake.\n\n5. Nxe5? c6! Attacking the white bishop and threatening 6...Qa5+. If the bishop moves (6.Ba4 or 6.Bc4), Black wins a piece with 6...Qa5+, forking the white king and knight.\n\n6. Nc4 White's best try, covering a5 and thus preventing 6...Qa5+, and threatening smothered mate with 7.Nd6#.\n\n6... d6! 7. Ba4 b5 Black forks the white bishop and knight, winning a piece for two pawns.\n\nNoah's Ark Trap: The Noah's Ark Trap is a chess opening trap in the Ruy Lopez. The name is actually used to describe a family of traps in the Ruy Lopez in which a white bishop is trapped on the b3-square by black pawns.\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. d4 Better moves for White are 5.c3, 5.Bxc6+, and 5.0-0.\n\n5... b5 6. Bb3 Nxd4 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. Qxd4?? Alexander Alekhine recommended this move in the tournament book for New York 1924 as a means for White to draw, but it is a mistake that loses material. White should instead play 8.Bd5 or try a gambit with 8.c3.\n\n8... c5 9. Qd5 Be6 10. Qc6+ Bd7 11. Qd5 c4 The white king bishop is trapped.\n\nSicilian Variation of the Noah's Ark Trap (Uncovered)\n\n1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 The Rossolimo Variation.\n\n3... a6 4. Ba4?? 4.Bxc6 is necessary and the point of 3.Bb5 itself.\n\n4... b5 5. Bb3 c4 (see diagram) And the bishop is similarly trapped.\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. 0-0 Nxe4\n\nOpen Variation of the Tarrasch Trap\n\nPosition after 11...Qd7? White wins a piece. 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. c3 Be7 10. Re1 0-0 11. Nd4 Qd7? (see diagram)\n\nFalling into the trap. 12. Nxe6\n\nNo matter how Black recaptures, the pawn on d5 will be pinned (along the d-file or along the a2\u2013g8 diagonal). After 12...Qxe6 or 12...fxe6 White wins a piece with 13.Rxe4.\n\nSteinitz Variation of the Tarrasch Trap (Uncovered)\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 This is the Steinitz Variation of the Ruy Lopez.\n2. d4 Bd7 Black breaks the pin to meet the threat of 5.d5. Now 7...0-0? falls into the trap.\n3. Nc3 Nf6 6. 0-0 Be7 7. Re1 (see diagram) Laying a subtle trap. Castling seems natural for Black but it loses a pawn. Instead, 7...exd4 is better.\n\n7... 0-0? 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Qxd8 Raxd8 11. Nxe5 Black's best move here is probably 11...Bd7, although White would remain a pawn ahead. 11... Bxe4?! 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 White can go astray too, 13.Rxe4?? would be a horrible blunder as Black would checkmate with 13...Rd1+ 14. Re1 Rxe1#. White blocks that possibility with his next move, making the threat real against the black knight on e4.\n\n13. Nd3 f5 The black knight cannot move because of the pin against the bishop on e7. 14. f3 Bc5+?! Better is 14...Bh4 15.g3 Nxg3 16.hxg3 Bxg3 where Black gets two pawns for the knight. 15. Nxc5 Nxc5 16. Bg5 Rd5 17. Be7 Re8 18. c4 1\u20130 White wins at least the exchange.\n\nFishing Pole Trap\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 The Ruy Lopez.\n\n3... Nf6 4. O-O Ng4 5. h3 \\[Another possibility is 5. Nc3 Bd6 6. d3 O-O which isn't too bad for Black.\\]\n\n5... h5 The key 'Fishing Pole' idea invites the capture of the knight in return for an open h-file.\n\n6. hg4 \\[Instead of taking the knight White may try, 6. Bc6 dc6 7. d4 ed4 8. Qd4 Qd4 9. Nd4 Ne5 but Black still has a good game.\\] \\[Or White may try, 6. Nc3 Nd4 7. Nd4 ed4 8. Ne2 a6 9. Ba4 Ne5 10. Nd4 c5 11. Nf3 Nf3 12. Qf3 b5 13. e5 Rb8 14. Bb3 c4\\]\n\n6... hg4 7. Ne1 Qh4 8. f4 g3 White gets checkmated on the next move",

I like the analysis  and historical examples that you added. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Beth would have intentionally used these traps. For one, they aren\u2019t mentioned in the book or seen in the series (the only trap mentioned is Scholar\u2019s Mate). Also, that wasn\u2019t her playing style. She  didn\u2019t rely on springing traps on her opponent. She waited until they made a blunder and then she punished them for it. I do believe that it is possible that some of her opponents at the high school simultaneous or Kentucky championship may have played themselves into 1 of these scenarios, and then she capitalized on it. \n\nWhat do you think?",

                "comment_text": "I think the interpretation is possible but unlikely \u2014 Here are a few things that I think it has trouble accounting for!\n\nThe dialogue that I think you\u2019re referencing runs as follows:\n\n\u201cConsider me your second. What do we need to help you beat Borgov?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what I need are the pills. The booze. I need my mind cloudy to win. I can\u2019t visualize the games without them.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? You think that\u2019s what brought you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea but you\u2019ve been doing fine without all that. Haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I threw away the pills. And then I asked the front desk where I can get more. I just really need them right now... Or I thought I did.\u201d\n\n1. I don\u2019t think she begs him to get her the pills in this dialogue as your interpretation suggests, and she seems open to at least the possibility that she doesn\u2019t need the pills to win.\n\n2. It seems like \u2014 from the dialogue \u2014 Townes is resisting her suggestion that she needs the pills to win. Why think he changes his mind later?\n\n3. It seems like from the actor\u2019s performance that Townes doesn\u2019t believe she needs the pills. This is a bit heavy on the subjectivity, but rewatch the scene and pay close attention to when Townes says \u201cReally? You think that\u2019s what brought you here?\u201d It seems like he\u2019s pretty skeptical that she needs the pills. Also, when she pauses after  \u201cI just really need them right now.\u201c it looks like Townes is about to object but Beth then says, \u201cor I thought I did\u201d. This part of the scene, I think, reinforces both that she is not begging for the pills and that Townes isn\u2019t motivated to give her any.\n\n4. He gives her the coffee when she wakes up, right before she receives a phone call from Benny, Beltik, etc. Benny says, \u201cit\u2019s 7am here but we\u2019ve been working on it for three hours\u201d. The time difference between NYC and Moscow is 7 hours, with Moscow being ahead. This suggests that the time when Beth wakes up is 2pm.\n\nBut the game continues in the evening at 5pm, as evidenced when she says on the phone, \u201cBenny, it\u2019s almost five here.\u201d And Benny responds, \u201cokay. Go beat him.\u201d This suggests that the drugs effects would have had to happen hours after the coffee was imbibed.\n\nNow this is a contestable point because we don\u2019t see the full three hours of the phone call, and she could\u2019ve chugged the coffee before she left for the game. But this strikes me as unlikely because (and this isn\u2019t a great point) it seems like coffee drinkers really hate tepid coffee haha. And we have reason to think that the coffee wasn\u2019t sipped over the few hours because we see her using the board while on the phone \u2014 if she were on the drugs, why not visualize the board then also?\n\n5. I think the interpretation where Townes slips her the pills goes against some of the show\u2019s overall themes. But this requires a longer discussion about what we take the shows themes to be. I\u2019ll flag it here though in case you haven\u2019t thought about your interpretations implications for the overall theme.",

This one is kinda the elephant in the room which I'm sure 99% of viewers noticed. Jolene's actress is just too damn old to play a child. The early episodes looked like a 29 year old woman hanging out with 11 year old kids. They even used the same actress to play a grown Jolene, so I suspect even the producers knew they were reeeeeally stretching it with her.\n\n2. I absolutely hated Benny Watts character's actor. I'm a chess fan, so I've seen tons of real chess players both on TV and in real life, and NO, I am absolutely not sold on this edgy boys band-looking kid (think Harry Styles from One Direction) as a US f*cking champion. Even the chess strategy lines out of the guy's mouth sounded like some sarcastic class clown's punchlines from the back of the class. Just... YUCK! -_-",

        "text": "Hello there, I'm a roleplayer who is looking for someone interested in developing the story and its characters beyond the finale's conclusion. I have the most experience writing as Beth Harmon. I have also written as Harry Beltik, Jolene and bits of Townes on the side. I am mostly looking for a Benny Watts but I am open to other pairings besides Benny/Beth. I am interested in picking up where the series concluded but I am open to AU ideas or tweaking events to suit our interests and narrative. I have a few ideas but I'd love to bounce them off of someone and make sure we're both contributing and happy with our direction.\n\nIf you haven't roleplayed before, it's where two (or more) people write a story together while writing as one (or more) main character, playing off the other to develop scenes together, as if you're both writing a singular story but just controlling certain roles (or sharing minor characters as needed). It's like creative writing meets improv, in a way. Like I said above, I am mostly seeking a Benny to my Beth but am open to other pairings (Harry/Annette for example) or even crossovers.\n\nGenerally I'd love to move to discord to write and discuss but might be okay with staying on reddit, I just don't check reddit PMs as much and find it a little tough to organize things. I tend to give a hefty couple of paragraphs (4-5) but if you're not as confident in your writing, I have no qualms if you can stick to around 3 paragraphs and maybe in a few months, you'll find yourself writing more without even realizing it! This is a long-term RP I'm looking for, between myself and one other person. Romance is expected to be very slow and gradual and to respect each other's comfort and of course time. I think given Beth's limits regarding many social situations (including anything romantic) things will be slow. In my mind, she and Benny are back to square one, following Moscow and will need to develop their friendship before making the official leap to something more.\n\nI would also love to develop Benny and his background, as well as our other side characters, while taking note of current events of the era we're in. In my mind, Beth will return to NYC to thank Benny for his help and might want to move up there (away from Lexington) and either focus on international chess tournaments or might even consider a life beyond chess, a lesson Alma, Beltik, Annette and Townes have already tried to teach Beth. What Benny is up to and where his goals are, we can discuss as well. If you're interested in writing together, please reach out to me via PM or chat and we can discuss where our interests are and our thoughts regarding characters and direction. Plot/conflict will not weigh as heavily as character development, if you're into a slow, slice of life story, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. \n\nAlso, I have mod permission to post this request. :)",

This proves she is capable of learning and growing as a person. \n\nWay I interpreted the ending, when, at the moment of the height of her fame, she takes the time to play chess with some random old dudes in the Moscow park: this is her way of, in effect, repaying the debt she owes to Mr. Shaibel. She can\u2019t repay him directly, as he is dead. Instead, she pays the favour on, helping out others.",

She had no reason to go back there but many reasons not to. \n\nCould they have met anyways? Sure. It would've been nice, but ultimately unimpactful. \n\nThe way it played out on the other hand had a huge impact! It was the final turning point for Beth. Up until then she always felt that people didn't *really* care about her. (I would argue some really did, but she didn't realize it). She built walls around herself, did not let anyone in, even actively drove people away, just so they wouldn't be able to hurt her. \n\nMaybe she thought she drove Mr. Shaibel away, too, with her request for money. After all, he never even bothered to call to get it back. So good riddance, right?\n\nOnly after he died she got to know the truth. Would it be heartwarming alone, she probably wouldn't change. But she's also confronted with the guilt. She didn't contact him either. She didn't reach out. She hid behind her walls so much, she wasn't able to see anyone else outside of them. And now there is no way to make it \"right\" again with Mr. Shaibel. And she has to live, knowing she can't change that. \n\nBut(!) she can change *herself* to not let that happen anymore. And this drives her to tear down the walls and ultimately earn the happy Hollywood-Ending she got. Without his death none of that would ring true.",

She also drills fundamentals like endgame tactics - again, consistently for years.\n\nIf you're an intermediate-advanced player (1400-1800 ELO) studying is a great way to start taking your game to the next level.",

I personally would love to find a friend slightly more experienced to play IRL so they can help talk me through their moves and coach me a bit on my own play - it's just so much better to have that in-person guidance versus virtual for me, since the tactile experience of playing on an actual board moving actual pieces helps me learn better and more quickly than playing online games (but that's just me). I guess maybe I'm hoping to find my own Mr. Shaibel, haha.",

                "comment_text": "Feel free to disregard this if you aren't looking for feedback but I have a few comments about how you produced this video.  I really enjoyed it, and the content itself is interesting and I like the concept of it, but I think there are a few tips that could really take a video like this to the next level.\n\nIf you are going to film yourself speaking in the video, make sure you are well-aligned with the camera, looking straight at it, and if you are going to feature an article of your own clothing, really show it off by ensuring it contrasts nicely with the backgrond.  Here, you are somewhat gazing down and not directly at the camera (so we end up looking up your nose a little), and the background is a white ceiling because the camera is lower than your eyeline.  The white of your top doesn't show up well and it ends up looking a bit shapeless, which doesn't do your design justice.  Raise the camera up so you are looking straight at it.\n\nIt's much too obvious that you are reading off a script.  If you must read off a prepared written document, breaking up the filming so some parts are a voiceover, and others have you in the shot will help a lot.  There's no need to have you in the video the entire time.  Because you are reading, half the video is you looking slightly off camera which is distracting.  Even if you weren't in the shot, you can tell by your tone of voice, and by the occasional pause in an unusual spot in a sentence, that you're reading something prepared.  Your voice sounds a bit disinterested also.   At the end of the video when you are no longer reading you sound more natural and less bored - so we know you do actually have a nice voice!\n\nAlso - SMILE!  You look great when you smile at the end!\n\nIf you are going to wear some of your hair down in the video, don't fuss with it while on screen.  Right now, it just looks a bit messy and adds to the \"unprepared\" / \"unkempt\" look, which really doesn't help when you are talking about fashion.\n\nCouple more comments about the content itself:\n\n- that's not a pixie cut, it's a bob or bowl cut\n\n- you mentioned the bubble dress, then as soon as you show the dress, you say he preferred geometric shapes that hide the female form --- the bubble dress seems to ENHANCE the female form (in contrast with his other styles), plus you then say how the bow is \"feminine\".  This bit could be reworked, it's a bit disjointed what you are trying to convey, and how the outfits you are showing while you are speaking relate to what you are saying at that exact moment.\n\n- \"cinches the waist\" (it's not \"kin-shez\", it's \"sin-shez\")\n\n- your audio has little clicks here and there.  Maybe your microphone is picking up some static or something?  A little bit distracting.\n\n- if sustainability is in the title of the video I think you could feature it more throughout.  I was waiting for you to even say anything about it and it was really just an afterthought at the end.  You could mention it at the beginning, comment here and there throughout about how each piece is refected in today's fashion and then summarise that idea at the end.  That would tie it all together nicely.\n\nAgain, I think it's a good video and I'm no expert at all, but I think you have a great foundation here to build on and I don't want potential viewers to miss out on your quality content just because there are a few tweaks that could really help you shine!",

Along with other characters like Jolene, Mr. Shaibel (of course!), and the orhphange. \nThey all loved her in their own way and it was so well written and acted that I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nI read a trivia that Marielle Heller, who played Alma, asked the director whether Alma's motive is motherhood or money in which the director never answered for her. He kept it a mystery and left it ambiguous, so as Marielle the actor navigated the character, so did we as an audience. Ultimately we see how Alma and Beth form a mother/daughter relationship that works for them and I see how some criticze it.\n\n\nBeing adopted myself, I cherished all my relationships with the good adult figures who raised me in this world, and was always bitter towards the idea that \"blood\" equals \"family.\" And being queer added to rejecting that idea. Alma's relationship with Beth to me isn't to be criticized for. None of them are. Everyone is complex, but she always looked out for Beth without being overbearing or too carefree. \nBeth's real mother seemed like she wasn't ready to have Beth, although we see she loved and cared for her, it still leads to her commiting suicide. That trauma and everyone in her life knowing about it makes it interesting to see how they interact with Beth (just assuming people know since Beth is a child prodigy that has been covered in newspapers her whole life - it was no secret she grew up in the orphanage). \n\nIt was really refreshing to see a take on all the family dynamics and relationships with friends and lovers that Beth encounters throughout her early life. I appreciated it a lot and how subtle yet powerfully moving it all was.",

        "text": "When I go back for another taste of some of my favorite parts of the Queens Gambit - as I\u2019m sure we all do - I am always drawn to her visit to the Methuen basement during Mr. Shaibel\u2019s funeral.\n\nThere Anya skillfully, wordlessly, beautifully conveys Beth\u2019s recollections of those early introductions, lessons, guidance and values Shaibel so lovingly gave to her as a young child. She assumed (if she gave it any thought at all) that his interest in her had ended with his $5 affirmation which had made it possible for her to enter her first chess tournament. It was their last direct communication.\n\nBut suddenly, glancing toward the back of his work area she sees something that looks familiar. On closer examination she finds that Mr. Shaibel had collected and preserved in this dreary basement that was now the cache of his life,  every piece of media ever published about her during her chess career. Tournament wins and losses, images, background stories, even the letter she had sent him requesting the $5 loan and the photo Mr. Ganz had taken of them when she was 9 years old. The only photo ever taken of them together. In this collection she recognizes his enduring  love and admiration\u2026 for her.\n\nAnd then suddenly it hits her. In her life people had always left her. Some by choice, some in death, but just as Alice, her mother, had once warned  \u201cone day you will be alone.\u201d  That fear of ending up alone was the basis of the constant anger in her that Shaibel had seen at once and warned her about.  But here in Shaibel\u2019s collection she discovers, she never really was alone. Shaibel had never left her. She had left him. And that sudden realization brought her to tears and finally dissolved the anger that had been her life-long companion. His final gift to her.  (It turns out Jolene had followed her too, but not with this detail.)  Every time I go back I feel the enormous power of that scene and the depth of Anya\u2019s non-verbal touching performance in it.",

I half expected him to pull away fearing a mistaken impropriety but was glad he didn't.  I liked when Ganz gave her the doll she gave a look like \"What do I want with this?\" but turning to Shaibel she saw he hoped she wouldn't embarrass his friend, and she came through with a smile and a \"Thank you very much.\"  more for Shaibel than Ganz , I think.  :-)",

If you have made enough moves (likely 30 in the KY State tournament and 40 in Cincinnati) what you get is a forced draw. \n\nTournaments back then that were timed didn't have adjournments and this was how they dealt with games that ran long.

So to accept your pov you play for the last move of the match. That's shitty chess. No way that's allowed. \n\nNow it's true I extrapolated that to the KY Tournament but given that was a state fricking championship, with 12 hours a day of chess on day one,  it's even more likely. Start times were set in stone. Time in between matches was obviously severely limited.  With shorter games than Cincinnati running out the clock becomes a very viable strategy. Especially if you have a viable defensive game and your opponent is better than you. Again shitty chess.\n\nBy the way the lines on time for both the KY State Championship and Cincinnati are exactly the same in the book by Tevis.",

In the Open, with Annette, there was no overtime bc it was an open tournament, which is a different format of tournament than the ones she plays in later.\n\nDon\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting this info.

If that's incorrect then KY stands alone as they gave few details on the next set of tournaments.\n\nYour pov has a player who has developed his/her position better, captured more pieces, but taken more time to do it, losing. The lesser player gets the point and the state championship potentially gets the most accomplished player of Bizarro Beat the Clock as its champion. Not Believable, I presented the most logical alternative but there could be another way that gets the job done.  I'll be glad to listen if you find one.",

The skill to portray vastly different characters in a believable manner and to evoke strong emotions from a viewer is, in my opinion, a clear sign that she has lots and lots of talent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like her acting style but I feel this kind of post is kinda \u2026 meaningless?

Her walk and body language grew more confident as she became more successful and reverted to the little girl poses whenever she was unsure or challenged. I don't know if that was the director's idea but it felt more like something she put personally into the role. I'm also impressed with how much she can convey without even speaking. She has the same ability that Scarlet Johansson does to shift her facial expressions really subtly to convey what the character is thinking or feeling. I wasn't super impressed with her in some of her earlier films (except for The Witch) but after watching QG I said to my wife \"if she doesn't win a bunch of awards for this I'll be really surprised\".",

It was just a magical production where so many things came together just right. Very difficult to reproduce.

Opens from the way they were shown on this show were kind of like the wild west, very very unpredictable  and for that reason something to be avoided. \n\nThe tournaments were not set up like the NCAA tournament for example where a 1 seed would be matched against a 16 seed. But basketball is single elimination and chess is not for one big difference. It kind of looked like the idea was to make all the games as competitive as they could based on the info they had. So 1-4 seeds might be in a group and 13-16 seeds might be in a group to start out with for example.\n\n.",

        "text": "In The Queen's Gambit featurette, the very first person in the video said it's not about chess but about, in his words, 'the cost of genius.' I understand when people say there can be natural downsides to talent; being preoccupied and obsessed with something, not fitting in, and more. What I dislike is how The Queen's Gambit, like so much entertainment before it, presents genius as something you have to pay for(usually at the cost of your mental health and stability). I was momentarily happy that The Queen's Gambit doesn't seem to have given Beth a mental disorder(to my knowledge) other than substance abuse disorder, which I think rooted more in an unhealthy coping mechanism from a shitty orphanage rather than something in her from the moment she was born or the direct result of her being a genius. This hope is taken away in statements such as the one above, as well as unrefuted sayings like, 'creativity and psychosis often come hand in hand. Or, for that matter, genius and madness.'\n\nI wish The Queen's Gambit didn't fall into the overused and therefore stigmatising trope of implying that incredible talent comes at the cost of your mental well-being, or that you can't be happy and talented, and I wish it could have remained as a unique approach to mental instability in gifted individuals; that anyone can have mental illness, and anyone can also not have mental illness. People with mental illness can lead happy lives, people without them can be miserable, and you don't have to be mentally unstable to be uniquely gifted in whichever skill you dominate.",

I mean, of course, you are not wrong with your general statement \u2013 people can be excellent at things without mental illness and people who have mental illnesses don\u2019t just happen to be geniuses at the same time. There is no direct causal relation between those two things and I understand your wish for a more diverse portrayal.\n\nBut while there is no causal connection I still feel the trope has developed because there is at least a strong correlation. From my experience the people who have great talent and the discipline to shape their talent into greatness MUST have a strong driving force that keeps them going forward. Greatness comes from exercising and practicing and honing your talent.   \n\n\nAnd those things can and will hurt. Becoming successful is not nearly as hard as staying successful. With a game like chess especially where you have a direct opponent and you have to conquer yourself, your fears, your insecurities. That the state of mind of a gifted individual is something that is being influenced by that pressure seems obvious to me. Sometimes you need to be obsessed with something in order to overcome your obstacles and that DOES come with a price. \n\nGreatness consumes your time, your social life and sometimes even your health. I simply don\u2019t believe anyone can be outstanding without being willing to do push themselves beyond some limits.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAgain, of course Beth could have been amazing without her struggle (and, in fact, she overcomes her greatest rival without the help of drugs). But this is her story, and she IS struggling. You said that you miss the portrayal of people who can be happy while being mentally ill \u2013 I feel like she is about to be very happy. She managed to impress and befriend a group of talented and kind young men who stuck by her side when she needed them the most. Her methods of dealing with people were \u201csocially awkward\u201d at times but they all were drawn to her nonetheless because they saw the real Beth. Someone who does care about people even if she cannot show it in that moment as well as others can.",

                "comment_text": "I see your point. So often, whenever a \"genius\" is portrayed (especially in movies or on TV), they are socially inept or are autsistic or both. And yes, TQG does not fully avoid that trap. But I'm happy that Beth is still shown socializing (well, at least trying to. Not necessarily getting much out of it, at least not at first, but that's simply the case for introverts, which I wouldn't call having a mental disorder). And I didn't get the feeling that she \"suffers\" from her genuis. She suffers from addiction. \n\nNow... a story without some kind of \"struggle\" is usually a boring one. And if the cause of the struggle stems from the same source as the strength, it's such a sweet irony that few storytellers can resist. That's not an excuse but an explanation why we have so many stories where a genuis has mental problems (the mind being the source of both). \n\nCould TQG have handled the subject better? Probably... but in it's defense, it's a story from 1983 so faulting it for the overwhelming amount of geniusses with mental problems that were portrayed in media since then is a bit harsh. Yes, they could have re-written it (which they did, a little.), but you can see how faithful they tried to stay to the book in every aspect, so changing too much would betray that. Yes, they could not have made a TV show of that story altogether. But then we wouldn't have this show that touched so many people so deeply. \n\nAnd I think your criticism simply goes too far. Beth IS both happy and talented. And her incredible talent does NOT *come at the cost* of her mental well being. Her mental well being came from being separated from her father, being raised by her unstable mother that tried to kill her (in the show, not in the book), from being put in an orphanage that drugged her and actively forbade her to use her talents. And from experiencing normalizing alcoholism. \n\nSo while I see your point, this is by far not the worst offender. And while you are of course free to attack anything you want, maybe this should not be near the top of the list.",

I completely get all your points and of course you're correct that you don't have to be mentally unstable to be uniquely gifted.  However, I think it is likely that there is some sort of correlation. That doesn't necessarily mean that being gifted *causes* the problems, so I suppose Mr. Shaibel's musings about what her gift would directly \"cost\" may be incorrect if you think about the phrasing. \n\nBut when you're that good at something that competitive and everyone you're competing against is the best of the best of the best, that *has* to come at a mental cost. Like Beltik said, you have to be really obsessed to win it all. That takes a toll, and some will handle it better than others. Others, like Beth, will feel like tearing their hair right out after a loss. It's just a unique stressor that will affect a population of geniuses much more often than the general population, presumably therefore increasing the risk of unhealthy neuroses. \n\nI've also heard that to be that incredibly gifted at a certain type of cognition or skill is a certain type of neurodivergency. I plan to look into that more later so I don't know how scientifically validated that is, but it does make sense. It's reasonable to think that it's at least probably *correlated* with neurodivergency. And again, that doesn't necessarily directly cause unhappiness, but it adds the particular stressor of being a neurological minority. \n\nThose are all just factors. I think there were many many other clear factors in the show that were part of a complex portrait of Beth's mental health. The sudden, traumatic way that she became an orphan; her caretakers providing her vulnerable, impressionable mind with powerful chemicals to get addicted to at the age of eight; her caretakers punishing her for acting on the substance abuse disorder they gave her by taking away the one thing that she loved; the sudden, traumatic death of the woman who had given her a new home and she had grown to love; and the genetic component from a clearly mentally unstable biological mother are all the other factors that played a hand in her mental instability. Being a chess genius is not the only one. \n\nSorry for writing a fucking novel lmao but I love both this specific topic and this show so I really wanted to give that perspective haha",

I got into a crazy chess phase a few months back, and it completely took over my life. I was playing for six hours a day, and when I wasn't playing, I was thinking about it or visualizing moves in my head. It got to a point where I was dreaming about it too, and I couldn't hold a conversation because I would start thinking about chess. I eventually had to completely stop playing chess. I think that's the point Beth got to, but she liked that feeling too much to stop. \n\nI think part of the reason she struggles so much from addiction is because she cannot escape from her own brain unless she is drinking or taking librium. Otherwise, her thoughts just keep racing.",

The next day, they continue the game and Beth strangely walks away while waiting for Georgi to make his move.

Prior to that scene, we see her solving her moves in the bathtub, with the substances in her system (we\u2019ve seen drugs in the show problematically act as a sort of mental power up). She was celebrated as a young prodigy, just like Georgi is at that point in time. Beth for that reason probably felt intimidated by him, as he was certainly doing well with this being her first adjournment (at least that we\u2019ve seen). There\u2019s also the cultural subtext of the relative strength of Russian players to American players at play here too. For her to walk away and back again is a show of power, both to prove to him and herself that she\u2019s not the same (child prodigy) but better. Beth is hyper-competitive; we don\u2019t really see her ease up until after she\u2019s won, where she makes a point to stress how good he is. \n\nBut yeah, she figured out every possible scenario during adjournment, via her obsession with chess that\u2019s mostly unparalleled by anyone else in the show. The kid couldn\u2019t keep up. \n\nAlso fun fact, the kid is Andy Serkis\u2019 son, if you didn\u2019t already know. I could spot the resemblance after.",

She played more aggressively after she saw his dentition, she watched him contemptuously. She even told him that he could've win if he didn't arrive late. What's the link between being late and winning or loosing the game ?\n\nAlso do you think that her new 'mother' is a hypocrite ? I mean, she was annoyed when Beth talked about chess and she was like \"if you want to make friends, don't play chess, go to a girl club.\" But when Beth got 100$, she immediately started to look for chess tournaments Beth could play in.\n\nI just finished EP2 so no spoiler please, thank you.",

If he didn\u2019t arrive late while his clock was running, he would\u2019ve had ample time to get to the point of beating her. There just wasn\u2019t enough time on his end. In poker, it\u2019s the same, you get time cards and if your timer goes out, it\u2019s an automatic fold or surrender. I also think the tear was her getting anxiety, feeling hormonal during her first-ever menstrual cycle, and feeling rage towards his condescension. When you\u2019re surrounded by people watching your every move, emotions run at a much higher level, like a drug in itself. She stepped away, gave herself a pep talk, figured it out, came back confidently and slayed lol.",

He arrives late because he doesn't see her as a threat. I assumed the tear was because of both frustration and embarassement at getting so upset over it. She told him that he could have won if he didn't arrive late because that's basically code for 'if you took me seriously instead of dismissing me because I'm a woman, you could have won.' And the stuff from her mum saying that she shouldn't play chess is kind of internalised sexism as well, but then she realises Beth is making money so she changes her mind. So maybe a bit hypocritical but more taking advantage of Beth's gift, I would say.",

But that's what I loved - it didn't hit you over the head with things.  You had to simply go with all that we were observing.",

        "text": "Finally watched this and it was mesmerizing. I felt the plot left a few small dangling loose threads (Chekhov\u2019s guns, really) that I was wondering if anyone else noticed or was fleshed out in the book:\n\n* Borgov handing Beth the King piece as part of his resignation. I felt this was a payoff for the State Department agent (CIA agent I\u2019m guessing?) saying that if there were any \u201cunusual signals\u201d, she should mention them. Handing the King to her appeared to be out of the ordinary and a symbolic gesture way of saying he wanted to defect to America. Either the gesture itself, or perhaps a hidden message placed inside the chess piece is another direction they could have gone with. (Something that Borgov could have had associates of his help to arrange). Since this is Beth\u2019s story, it\u2019s understandable that they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to devote too much time to this, but a one-liner of Beth handing the agent the piece and him saying \u201cthat\u2019s fantastic! It could mean Borgov wants to defect! We\u2019ll get our agencies right on this.\u201d would have been a better payoff than leaving it dangling.\n* The young Russian boy Beth played. I expected her to encounter him again in Russia and I wondered when we\u2019d see her encounter him. Perhaps he\u2019s 16 years old at that point, and he isn\u2019t on the path to becoming a world champion, and his journey has been coming to accept this and he thanks her for bringing him along that path. He still plays chess \u201cfor fun\u201d maybe - it no longer defines his life. Something along those lines. It would have been easy to have a minute or so scene to deliver some sort of payoff on that one given she was in Moscow, and surely this boy would have been in town a part of the tournament or he could have traveled there.\n\nDoes the book pay off on either of these events?",

Him handing the king piece is just poetic and satisfying since this was Beth's toughest rival, plus it ties to Beth's overall arc of playing for the love of the game vs playing just for winning's sake. This isn't a dangling thread or a Chekhov's gun, the thing with the CIA agent just establishes him as a dick and the state of US/USSR relations. Plus, do you seriously want Beth's big victory moment and the great ending to be undercut by a defection message? Nobody cares about Borgov.\n* Everything you say about the young russian boy just sounds like a russian Harry Beltik. I don't think it would've been good or interesting to see that.",

And your reasoning seems off - if the intention was simply to establish the CIA agent as \"a dick\", why would he **specifically** ask about chess related gestures / signals from Borgov? And additionally why would the director zoom in on the piece? TBH, I think this idea was on the director/writers' mind but they decided to trim whatever aftermath scenes or dialog related to this. There's a billion ways the agent could have been \"established\" as a dick, yet this is a very specific reference to unusual gestures during a chess game, and furthermore, the show establishes laying down the king, but never establishes handing a King piece as being a normal gesture. No other character does this.  \nFurthermore, Borgov up to this point doesn't do a single thing to indicate he's a gracious loser who would make this gesture. In fact, he even meets with his colleagues to attempt to thwart Beth's attempts to win. There's **zero** indication he's the kind that would have handed her the piece prior to this as a \"symbolic gracious gesture\" as you put it.  \nI think you dismiss it too easily and unless you have direct evidence from the writer/director, I wouldn't speak so authoritatively.",

I found my heart racing during her big games. I got pumped up when her orphanage friend stopped by for a visit, only to be filled with sorrow when she finds out that Shaibel died and had been keeping track of all of her games. There was female empowerment that destroyed stereotypes without dragging anyone down. In fact, the fact that all the men that were in her life came together to support her and help her beat the big ~~Ivan Drogo~~ Borgov was great. The way they humanized the Soviets and how they came to deeply admire her was great. Everything was great. Great story. Great storytelling. Great cinematography. Great actors. *Especially* Anya. Every little aspect of the story came together in the end for a great finale. My one complaint that she continued playing after the recess when she accidentally stumbled upon the curly-headed Russian discussing his strategy against her with Borgov. But you know how Borgov made an unsuspected move after she discussed all possible strategies Borgov would make with the men back home? The Soviets probably wired tapped Beth's phone and were listening to her. Every detail came together in the end. Despite the dark elements of the story, it was a really refreshing thing to watch.",

I still think he might be, but my original hypothesis was that he was one of Beth's mom's advisors in graduate school. However, Beth's mom's PhD was from Cornell, so why would he end up in Lexington unless he was switching departments and working at the University of Kentucky. So either he moved and she moved with him, and things got bad and that's how she ended up in the trailer, or he's the dad but she met him after leaving Cornell (maybe she was going to be a postdoc in Kentucky or something and that's how she ended up there)....like when you think about it, why did she go to Kentucky after getting her PhD at Cornell? Did she follow this dude to Kentucky, or did she move for another reason and met him in Lexington?\n\nIdk, I'm in academia so trying to figure out how all the pieces go together with that scene involves a lot of job moves and such, which are rare\\* (and I don't think a Cornell prof would change jobs to work at UK, even though UK is not a bad university). Plus, a very close friend of mine was the result of a relationship between a grad student and a professor at a different university, so perhaps I am sensitized to that possibility here as well.\n\n\\*edit: after one receives tenure....esp. going from Cornell to Kentucky - rare but not entirely impossible.",

Her mother dies in a car crash, as depicted in the film, however, Beth was NOT in the car with her. She was alone at home. Her father had died a year earlier, thus leaving her an orphan.\n\nIn the film scene at the trailer, her mother is arguing with a man who states Beth is \"our daughter.\"  There is no affirmation they are married but  the other details of their history are left to our imagination.  Recall in the opening  scene in Mrs. Deardorf's office as they reviewed the file on Beth after noting her mother's death, Ferguson asked \"And the father?'  Deardorf \"Doesn't say.\"  To which Miss Lonsdale offers \"Perhaps like many men from there, a victim of a 'carefree life' \"  I would take that to mean they were not married and had not lived together as a family. In the movie, 9 year-old  Beth witnesses her mother arguing with him at his new house. When she returns to the car, Beth asks \"Mama, who was that?\"",

Commuting to Lexington everyday was simply not doable. He was not imo an active academic.\n\nAs for Beth's mother being in KY her birth certificate has her born in Louisville in 1928 so that parts not unreasonable.\n\nWhat still floors me is the Phd by early 1948 at the latest. I have a Masters and my mom a Doctorate so I also know what's involved and a Doctorate that fast is hard to believe.\n\nYou could take overloads and summer classes and maybe cut the Bachelors down to three years but the problem is is that once you get to the upper division the classes you need are not only not offered every semester but in the case of Grad school (and some 4th year stuff) they are often not even offered every year. Add to that the oral and written exams, the dissertation, and its defense and it gets hard to buy this time table. That said math is the only discipline where it theoretically could happen imo.",

The only reason Math seems slightly less ridiculous is that I would think the research costs would be less.\n\nAs for your case I sympathize.

Sterling which is about an hour east of Lexington and again no father was listed. In that day and age an Herculean effort would have been made to find the father so that the state would not end up responsible. The fact that none was found is evidence that Alice was not living anywhere near family or friends.

It certainly looks like the US but I actually don't think they filmed in Lexington at all!\"\n\nNo afaik none of it was filmed anywhere near Lexington .",

When Beth wins the moscow international, how big of a tournament is that? Borgov is the world champion, and i know she didnt take that title by beating him. It ended with her being able to play him for the title in 2 years. So is the moscow international a kind of qualifier? How many from the tournament may participate in the championship then? \n\nI really need some kind of pyramid with the world championship on top. \n\nDoes anyone know, or maybe can link me to a site with good information?

Moscow did that for her.\n\nIn the book Beth's 1st rating came in the March after the KY State Tournament and was 1881. In the summer before Mexico City it had risen to 2243 and later about 2370. International Grandmaster Ratings start at 2400.\n\n\\*aka Benny Watt's comment about opens. They can be a hazard to your rating.",

Bill portrays the ferry boat guy Mr. Jolly, who brings a complaint to Lincoln early in the film that his grant is being poached. Lincoln promises to look into it but in the meantime he asks the Jollys to visit their congressman \"Beanpole\" Burton to persuade him to vote for passage of the 13th Amendment. It works. \"Beanpole\" votes with Lincoln.",

On the last episode of the series I thought about the scene that occurred earlier into the show where she breaks into the pharmacy and takes a whole bunch of \u201ctranquility\u201d and she faints. I was thinking about what if after taking all that medication if she feel into coma or something the of sort and she imagined her self being the best chess player in the world and the entire show depicts the story inside of her head as she is in this coma. It would make sense that her mind would go there as she had been taking the pills quite frequently to play chess. She was fascinated with chess and realized that these pills would make her see the game like no other, so when taking all those pills at once she might\u2019ve imagined them taking her to be the best. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve made any sense but I thought it was a cool little theory that I might share. Let me know what you think and if anything I said could have been wrong or disproven already.",

Why would Cleo, an incredibly beautiful woman,  hang out with those two poor losers who just happened to be ex-pat chess players?  She was keeping an eye on their activities.  And how did she make a living?  Why, in \"fashion\".  Pretty general, if you ask me, especially if she could afford to live in NY, Berlin and Paris.  International travel was extremely expensive in the 1960's.  And Berlin was the perfect place for a spy to report to her superiors. \n\nThe Soviets got a lot of prestige from their chess prowess, which demonstrated the superiority of the Commie system, much like the Olympics were going to demonstrate the master race of Nazi Germany. \nThey were willing to do whatever it took to maintain that, and Cleo could give Borgov an edge.  Bobby Fischer was left out of this story, but he humiliated the best Soviet players.",

I don\u2019t want like 10 years from now she\u2019s struggling with addiction again & has isolated herself from all her friends & also this other significant person in her life died.  I want like \u201dHere is your 1 minute 20 second clip for confirmation that Beth went on to live an ultimately happy life, maintaining sobriety & her friendships & found a greater purpose & closure, but like in a really in-your-face way like yes you could probably assume that from the original ending, but here this is her celebrating New Years & exchanging gifts with all her friends 10 years later and one of twins had his own set of twins & she\u2019s teaching them Russian as babies bc start early & then the other twins has older twins and she\u2019s teaching them chess & Harry is I don\u2019t know somehow we fit in the fact that he\u2019s a professor and Jolene\u2019s a civil rights lawyer and she adopted orphans from their orphange and Billy has to take off his knife when he comes in because that\u2019s not child safe.  Did people actually care about baby proofing things and child safety in the 70s? No, it\u2019s probably not historically accurate at all but it makes you feel GOOD so we\u2019ll throw it in there.  Actually maybe for historical accuracy he\u2019ll give the BABIES their own KNIVES as presents (isn\u2019t there a my favorite murder joke about that?) anyways lets pan away to a wall of framed photographs of her & her friends throughout the years, we\u2019ll throw in that picture of her leaving Russia where she looked the one guy whose name escapes me straight in the eye/camera, and in the center of this photo collage is the picture of her & mr shaibel.  Is this overt display of sentimentality kind of out of character for Beth\u2019s personality? Absolutely.  But this isn\u2019t about the story line, this is about you, the overly emotionally invested, overly sensitive viewer.  This is for YOU.\u201d This is part of my campaign for all films & series to offer a 1-5 minute \u201dalternative/additional ending\u201d for hyper sensitive people who need extra closure.  It can be like Seth Meyers\u2019 one Netflix special where they had a skip option within the special so u could skip ahead if u didn\u2019t want to hear the political jokes & maybe even it\u2019s like that one black mirror episode where it\u2019s like choose your own adventure (or traumatic demise bc it\u2019s black mirror after all) it\u2019s like look, just whatever is gonna give you the lost closure do it.  Is this what fan fiction is for? I\u2019m not sure like Im seriously asking.  Is fan fiction more horny or sentimental, I\u2019ve never delved into it. But Netflix this is all I want is like instead of \u201dare u still watching?\u201d just have exactly that format \u201ddo you need more closure even at the expense of realism, massive changes in tone & characters, and historical accuracy?\u201d and then it's just some ridiculously fluffy 10 years from now thing.  Or they could have a \u201djust fuck me up\u201d option, and it's like EXTREMELY depressing.",

(I have not scrolled through this sub-reddit so excuse me if this has been beaten to death already)  What do you think of the possibility that Borzov's offer of a draw was an indication he might defect.   Obviously, the State Department guy thought defection was a possibility, and told Beth to watch for anything unusual.  Was the offer that unusual to constitute an offer?",

Except, the logic of the show is so taut-  the best I can recall -  I don't understand the State Department guy's line if it leads nowhere.   Unless, pure speculation here, the writers put in the line to increase suspense in conclusion.  Will she win or lose? becomes Will she win or lose or will everything explode when Borzov defects?  \n\nPS- My question came to mind on the third viewing, so I admit over-thinking a possibility.  I was enthralled by the script and the cinematography and appreciated both more on subsequent viewings.  Thanks, anyway.",

Thomas thinks that Benny is in fact a hippie in some way or another, but tries to be true to himself still. About the knife - Thomas actually wanted to keep the knife and thought it's funny that Benny never uses his knife. He (Thomas) assumes that Benny simply wanted to broadcast how different he is from the rest - he wants to set himself apart from other chess players. Thomas also pointed out that Benny tries to intimidate opponents with how he is relaxed and comfortable im his own skin. (And he comments at the end that he looks like a pirate)\n\nEnjoy!",

Also, I haven\u2019t finished the series yet so I may discover I\u2019m wrong. But when I watched it I felt that Cleo feels different than most models and was drawn to Beth because she recognizes that Beth is a smart and talented woman that also happens to be beautiful. Beth was refreshing to Cleo because she usually deals with people that have less substance in modeling. They are not seen as people with talent by society even though there are talents unrecognized or unknown by the general public. They are simply viewed as beautiful people. Cleo herself is smart and self sufficient and her career can be lonely too. I simply felt like Cleo recognized that she\u2019d met someone similar to herself and they hit it off because of that. Birds of a feather so to speak.",

She wins against big bad and it feels handwavey because we don't really understand the difficulty of what's going on. We barely see the board let alone know what the challenge is. She activates her super power and wins.\n3. She just gives up her chemical dependency with no repercussions.\n4. ALL of her chess friends show up in New York at Benny's apartment. Benny has apparently forgiven her despite his very good reason for not doing so that he talks about earlier in the episode. How each of these people arrive at Benny's apartment is downright comical. I half expected the janitor to show up. How do these people even know each other? The twins aren't on the same level as these other guys and yet they're also in the brain trust somehow?\n5. Your State Department tail is going to stick to you like glue, they aren't just going to let you ditch them.\n6. Beth doesn't fix any of the problems she's created amongst the people she's interacted with. They just forgive her because she's playing against the big bad. There's no character growth here, no revelation; her problems just get resolved like an unearned It's A Wonderful Life.\n7. They send a kid outside to tell people what each move is? They're playing way too fast for that to be practical. By the time he's told the kid what move has occurred there's already been at least three more moves played.\n8. When she has that match with the older guy with the hair, that mutual admiration seems unearned, since this is the first time we've actually seen this guy. She might have talked about him, but the name of the game is \"show, don't tell.\"",

Secondly, I don\u2019t feel like that revelation was earned because he was giving Beth come hither looks from the moment he laid eyes on her. In what way is this a gay man when he was burning through his every pore for her? Even in Moscow, the two of them had more chemistry than she did with any other guy in the show. Unfair that they didn\u2019t wind up together. I wanted them to get married and have gorgeous, brilliant babies with luminous eyes.\n\nIn my head canon, they did just that and I won\u2019t be talked out of it!",

                "comment_text": "Okay. I understand you may have only been going for cosplay in the sense of dress up, and not really thought about lighting/processing.  I'm really in to that stuff though so I saw a lot of things I would have done differently if I'd shot it.  So, I\u2019m just sharing my perspective in the hope you can pick something up from it.  Even if you disagree with everything, maybe there is something in here you can use to your advantage later.\n\nLighting:\n\nMost of the series is shot with available light. Often just one light. Often you can tell they put big lights outside windows and faked sunlight. Sometimes they\u2019ll use a fill or a rim light from the other side of the key light. Rarely you\u2019ll see a hair light. Its almost always very soft light. Exceptions to that are when it is for drama/harshness or the environment doesn\u2019t allow anything else. E.g. The stuff in the basement. Or the end finale where they just use the overhead lights of the tables.\n\n\\-Your image has mixed color temperatures. Look at the color of the skin on your hands vs. face. This comes from multiple light sources with different types of bulbs and/or temperature settings. Before adjustable LEDs they used colored \u201cgels\u201d to match lighting temperatures.\n\n\\-The light on your hands is also brighter than the light on your face, pulling attention away from your face.\n\n\\-The hair light is so bright it pulls attention away from your face.\n\n\\-The lower catch light in your eyes is something a lot of photographers will hide in photoshop. This light doesn\u2019t happen in one light setups. If you look at QG stills you\u2019ll notice you never see a lower catch light anywhere near this strong.\n\n\\-The highlight on your nose makes your skin look shiny. Beth\u2019s skin rarely looks shiny.\n\n\\-With their lighting, Beth\u2019s skin often falls harder to shadow on the far side of the key light.\n\nProcessing:\n\nThey often use smoke to add texture. You can tell when you see the light rays in the room. One of the side effects of that is that is \u201cflattens\u201d the image. They also add grain because they want it to look like film (because everything of the time was on film).  On top of that they use a \u201cflat\u201d color palette. Not much \u201cpops\u201d unless they want it to.\n\nYour image has a texture that uses clarity and contrast \u2013 it gives it a trendy modern \u201cgrit\u201d or \u201ccrunchiness\u201d. The QG feels more like a period piece.\n\n[I made a few edits here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j77iwi0xacgq96y/bnar4g4i76n61.jpg?dl=0)\n\n1. Flipped left to right because your hair part is on the other side.\n2. I \u201cwarmed\u201d the lighting temperature of your hands to bring them more in line with your face\u2019s temp\n3. I burned your hands exposure, wrist jewelry, and hair light all down so they take less attention from your face.\n4. I burned the shadows down on the side of your face most covered by hair.\n5. Pulled down vibrance, saturation and clarity.\n6. Removed lower catch light in eyes.\n7. Added grain\n8. Played with overall color temperature until I got closer to her pale/porcelain tone.",

In episode 5, after Beth beats Benny and they go drink at the bar, Benny says there will be 4 soviets and 4 other countries at the Moscow invitational. However, in episode 7, Ionly counted three: Laev, Luchenko and Borgov. The others being Shapkin (UK???) Duhamel (France) Flento (Italia), Beth (USA) and Hellstrom. Technically, that should mean Hellstrom would be Soviet, however when the guy introduced him at the opening round, he didn\u2019t say \u00ab\u00a0SSR\u00a0\u00bb like he said with Borgov, Luchenko and Laev. He said something I didn\u2019t understand even after 10 listens, but perhaps someone did? Did I miss something?\nUpdate: Since Hellstrom is Swedish, the only thing that makes sense is that Shapkin is Soviet, but idk why but I don\u2019t like that possibility, since he isn\u2019t with his mates during Luchenko\u2019s adjournment",

        "text": "I honestly feel like this is easily one of the best shows or movies I've ever watched in my life.   The writers and directors did such an amazing job with this show.   I think one thing that stuck with me the most is how complex and interesting all the characters were.   They all had very distinct personalities, like a certain flavor.   No one was particularly generic.  Normally, in cases like this you'd say all the characters were \"grey\" but I wouldn't say that exactly fits.  I feel like all the characters were the opposite of grey, very colorful, like they all were the main character of their own story.  Even though some of them did bad things they would sometimes do good things and you sort of had this feeling like all of them had a reason to act the way they acted.   I'd say Mr. Wheetley was probably the most \"bad\" character but even with him you get the sense that he feels justified from his own perspective, like the world turned on him and he's in the right, even though from our perspective it's clear that's not the case. I think even with Beth if you look at her objectively, you can't say she's a good person exactly.   An outsider would see the way she acts and probably condemn her.   But since we've seen everything she experienced, her reason for doing the things she does, we can't help but root for her and empathize with her.\n\nWith this show, it's hard for me to say what the \"message\" was exactly.   I feel like it was just a well crafted story.   There are so many themes and ideas presented through the whole thing that it seems impossible to pick just one to define the show.",

You might be able to appreciate how one move could turn a whole game, but they didn't just use a \"secret technique\" or \"activated their trap card\".

                "comment_text": "Alright, let's address your points one by one:\n\n1) If a grandmaster sees the Bird's opening (the opening in the post), you can bet they'll be caught off guard, as most people don't study a lot of Bird theory, given that it's such an unusual opening choice. So, yes, you CAN be surprised on move 1.\n\n2) That's just false. Many times, a weaker player will look at a move and say, \"there is no way this move works for my opponent!\" - especially if such a move involves sacrificing loads of material with compensation that only truly manifests itself in at least a couple of moves' time. One low-level example of one potential such move is Nxe5 in the Legal trap, where the queen is sacrificed for checkmate in 2 moves. A higher-level example is the double rook sacrifice in Anderssen's Immortal game. \"How is such a move even possible?\" is in fact a very common reaction to brilliant tactical sequences.\n\n3) In some cases, the better player really does use a \"secret technique\" and has \"activated their trap card\" that the weaker player simply isn't good enough to comprehend. A great demonstration of this is Plaskett's puzzle, where the \"weaker player\" is actually the world's strongest engine, Stockfish, which would beat the world's strongest ever human, Magnus Carlsen, 100 times out of 100. To solve the puzzle, one must use a secret technique completely inaccessible to Stockfish, no matter how much time you give it. If the greatest player ever, by a mile, is able to get trapped by a move every single time, you better be sure it's not because it \"messed up\" but because the opponent was \"particularly clever\".\n\n4) To elaborate on 3), while Plaskett's puzzle involves a long-term strategical plan, and hence the trap itself doesn't occur in one move, there are other positions that Stockfish can't comprehend from the get-go where its evaluation of the position really does change in just one move. A good example is my own puzzle (which can view at [https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/3wJuBFMLia](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/3wJuBFMLia)), where in the initial position Stockfish says Black is completely winning, but after Bc6, it immediately realises it is getting mated in less than 20 moves. So, yes, traps really can occur over just one move, which is often then followed up by a forced tactical sequence.\n\n5) A chess game cannot be won without any mistakes from the opponent. Actually, NO game on planet Earth, apart from silly ones like tic-tac-toe, can be won if the opponent doesn't make mistakes. That's just how games work. So if you can calculate farther than anybody else on the planet, then it's you who is the genius, and not the rest of the human species who are idiots. In the same vein, when Messi does something spectacular, the first instinct isn't to bash the defenders - it's to recognise Messi's genius. The same applies to chess. So that you get e.g. the Plaskett's puzzle position and you lose, then you just have to admit that your opponent is a genius, and there is nothing you can do about it, even if you are by far the strongest chess player that has ever existed.",

I often hear this phrase in relation to footballers humiliating defenders with their dribbling skills, for example. So the fact that this same phrase is commonly used in relation to extraordinary chess moves shouldn't come across as a suprise.\n\nA grandmaster wouldn't be surprised by the Bird in the sense \"oh, I've never seen this opening before, damn, they got me!\", so much as they would be in the sense \"I have only studied two or three variations in the Bird and only know it more or less decently about 6 moves deep, so I might get into trouble really quickly here if my opponent understands this opening's strategical ideas better and deeper than I do\".

I don\u2019t, and here is why I think she is motivated by money rather than love for Beth. \n\nAt the start of the second episode, she doesn\u2019t even consider Beth\u2019s love of chess and usually writes off her success with \u201coh... that\u2019s nice\u201d or \u201csome physical exercise could do you good\u201d or \u201chow about joining a girls club.\u201d She even yells at her about wanting to work to enter a tournament. \nAll of their early interactions are akin to servant orders (fill my prescription, get me cigarettes, heat up dinner, fetch my pills, etc). She\u2019s practically a servant in this household, and It isn\u2019t until Beth starts earning money and fame that Alma seems even remotely interested in her or her passions. Infact, the camera focuses in on her face when Beth mentions the possibilities of thousands of dollars in prizes, and you see an excited reaction unmatched by any other scene in the episode.\n\nFrom that point onward, almost all of Alma\u2019s interactions with the chess world are from the perspective of money. How much profit they will make, how expensive and nice the hotel rooms with be, if she can take a cut of the earnings. When she does express concern for Beth, it often feels insincere, like her money machine has stopped working for a moment. Sure they share a few nice moments, but Alma seems to mostly use Beth for money while also introducing her to a plethora of new mind altering substances to drown in (without any of the tools to navigate them safely). How convenient is it that Alma just so happens to start forming a relationship with Beth immediately after she finds out she can earn some serious cash?\n\nI\u2019m writing this because i have seen a lot of articles and posts talking about the \u201cloving\u201d relationship between Beth and Alma. I think Alma is actually pretty manipulative and kind of disgusting from a moral standpoint. I\u2019m pretty confident she loves Beth, but love and morality are very different aspects of character. What are your thoughts, I would love to hear your perspective on this. Do you believe Alma is truly a good person deep down?\n\nEDIT: Maybe a better question, since human beings are more complex than black and white moral planes. Do you think Alma\u2019s efforts to further Beth\u2019s passion for chess are motivated by money or love for her daughter?",

After going through a loveless marriage where she was devalued and belittled, she was prescribed drugs from doctors who likely thought she was hysterical (helped no doubt by her husband) and became addicted to both those and alcohol. Already dredged in such a life, she was given a teenaged girl to adopt (something that was apparently her husband\u2019s idea to placate her) and it was something she clearly wasn\u2019t ready for. Likewise, she wasn\u2019t prepared to raise an unusual child like Beth with such an unusual hobby. I doubt she knew anything about chess. Upon going bankrupt after her husband vanished, Beth making money wasn\u2019t only an opportunity for her to dig herself out of a hole, but Beth as well. She seemed to have to work up the nerve to even ask for 10%, which is comparatively a very small fee. When Beth pursued her passion, she made sure it happened and by all accounts listened carefully to what Beth had to say even if she didn\u2019t understand all of it. \n\nDoes this make Alma a \u201cgood\u201d character morally? Nope! She was a negligent mother and she undoubtedly only took an interest once money started exchanging hands. As the adult, it was her responsibility to look out for Beth\u2019s best interests, and she didn\u2019t manage to do exactly that. But to say she\u2019s morally disgusting and manipulative is a step too far IMO, and the image of her as a one dimensional abusive character does a disservice to her character. People can contain multitudes \u2014 Alma can love Beth and want what\u2019s best for her while still being motivated by money, and I think the glimpses we get of her backstory (neglected, undervalued, desperate for love) tell a compelling story of its own. It\u2019s not too dissimilar to Beth, who you could say uses the people around her, but following her from childhood to adulthood, we get a more explicit image of why that is. \n\nTl;dr: she\u2019s not a good person or a bad person. She\u2019s just a person trying her best in a shitty situation who made a lot of bad choices along the way. Just my two cents!",

That's an act of unselfishness & kindness all by itself. \n3. On the same afternoon Alma grieved learning her husband had left her,  when Beth came home to announce her own crisis, she stopped thinking about her own loss and rose to help her daughter (\"I think I can learn to be a mother.\").\n4. Beth was still 15 when winning in KY. Without Alma's help the agenda of more tournaments that gave Beth the opportunity to develop her gift could not have happened ( H.S. excuses, bus, hotels, flights, etc.) Some may question her financial motive but it was modest compared to Beth's reward, and clearly she saw this is what Beth wanted even more. And Beth offering 15% instead of 10% was a voluntary admission of her appreciation.  She did not feel exploited.\n5. Beth appreciated Alma assuming the role of her mother. She introduced her as such; welcomed the warm engraving on her graduation watch; valued her talks and company with Alma.  Alma was a reliable port in the storm for Beth in what had certainly been a stormy voyage before they met.\n\nAlma was not perfect but like all good parents of teenagers tried to help her and Beth came to love her for it.",

                "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t see Alma that way at all.\n\n>\tAt the start of the second episode, she doesn\u2019t even consider Beth\u2019s love of chess and usually writes off her success with \u201coh... that\u2019s nice\u201d or \u201csome physical exercise could do you good\u201d or \u201chow about joining a girls club.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the era the show is set in. For one thing, girls simply were not expected to play chess - it was considered a men\u2019s pastime and a nerdy one at that. For a young woman, to find a husband and establish a family was the most important priority, so Alma encouraging Beth to socialize instead of pursuing her passion for guess would\u2019ve been seen as \u201cgood parenting\u201d. Also, one should note that Alma keeps suggesting that Beth pursue a life outside of chess, to eat, drink, relax and have fun so that her life isn\u2019t consumed by one thing. Some of the happiest times for Beth in the show and book are when she does decide to kick back with Alma and do girly mother-daughter things. \n\n>\tIt isn\u2019t until Beth starts earning money and fame that Alma seems even remotely interested in her or her passions.\n\nIn the scene in which Alma reveals that her husband has left them she and Beth concoct a plan to keep that information a secret in so that Beth isn\u2019t returned to the orphanage; Alma also says that she wants to try to learn to become a mother - all of this transpires before Beth starts raking in money from her tournaments. This is a woman with no job who was just abandoned with no means of taking care of herself, much less an orphan - deciding to continue to be a mother to her adoptive daughter. Also, about Alma\u2019s disinterest in Beth\u2019s chess hobby: this is the late 1960s, a parent was not going to get involved with their child\u2019s hobbies, it would\u2019ve been unusual for a parent to go with their child to every hobby function - that\u2019s a modern development in parenting. \n\n>\tintroducing her to a plethora of new mind altering substances to drown in (without any of the tools to navigate them safely).\n\nShe introduced Beth to alcohol, and even then hesitatingly at first. Beth was already well-accustomed to sedatives on her own and picks up weed at the college party. A sixteen year old being allows to drink in the company of a parent or guardian in the \u201860s wasn\u2019t seen as big of a deal as it is today, traditional parents would allow their teens a champagne or beer during a birthday, NYE party or some other celebratory occasion. \n\n>\tHow convenient is it that Alma just so happens to start forming a relationship with Beth immediately after she finds out she can earn some serious cash?\n\nThe relationship was already established before Beth began earning money. Alma asks for a ten percent agent\u2019s fee for the work that she does: making hotel and travel arrangements, chaperoning Beth, making excuses for Beth\u2019s absences from school - all things that were essential for Beth to attend all those tournaments, as a minor she could\u2019ve have done any of it without Alma. And Beth increases the fee to fifteen percent as she knows that Alma is her partner and facilitator  in this endeavor. \n\nOh, Something that stuck me as a watch collector is the scene in which Alma gives Beth a Bulova watch, which I found out was a [Bulova American Girl K](https://timeandtidewatches.com/the-queens-gambit-bulova/) which cost approximately $59, which would be around $551 in today\u2019s money. If Alma\u2019s interest was wholly in making a profit from her daughter then why would she buy her a five hundred dollar gold luxury watch engraved with a message from her on the caseback? \n\nThe way I see it the love and affection that Alma had for Beth was genuine. In Mexico Alma keeps offering to spend time with Beth and it\u2019s Beth who declines. When Beth goes to the college party she calls home and tells Alma to go to bed, which means that Alma would wait up for her to come home. Alma would listen to Beth\u2019s concerns and rants about a game that she knew little about but understood was important to her daughter. Sure she benefitted from traveling, food and essentials from Beth\u2019s winnings, but they were two unemployed women in Midcentury America who were left alone to provide for themselves, something that they handily are able to do. And in the show and book she never tells Beth what to do or takes money from her, even though as Beth was a minor in the \u201860s so any money she made would\u2019ve legally been Alma\u2019s. Sure, their relationship was codependent and unhealthy, but Alma grew to be  emotionally supportive and proud of Beth, who she saw as much a friend as a daughter - something to be expected as Beth was adopted at such an advanced age. It\u2019s the relationship with Alma that Beth obviously valued the most, which is more clear in the book than it was in the show, although I still felt the show got it across well.\n\nEdit: misspelled word.",

I think Alma developed genuine affection for Beth and I think she was also using her. \n\nAlma\u2019s problem was that she was stuck in passivity, which is exactly what Beth told Mr. Wheatley at their last meeting. Alma always looked to other people to take care of her and she was never able to rise above and take care of herself or anyone else. Most women, when their husband left them, would have put on their best day dress and gone out to get a job at a department store or something to get house and home together for herself and her children. But, Alma was obviously raised to have certain expectations from her life as a woman and she stubbornly held on to them, even when they went against her best interests. She reminds me of Sally at the end of the Charlie Brown cartoon, screaming how she was cheated out of treats because she waited for the Great Pumpkin. And, like Alma, she also did what she did for the sake of a man \u2014 although I\u2019d be the first to argue that Linus Van Pelt is several cuts above Mr. Wheatley.\n\nI think Alma saw Beth\u2019s chess abilities as a way out of a bleak financial future but she was also really proud of her.\n\nEmotionally, I think she treated Beth more like a pet, especially at first. She didn\u2019t even change her last name from Harmon, which confused me.  I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure, at first, that Beth had really been adopted. \n\nShe didn\u2019t try to get to know Beth; she didn\u2019t ask her anything about her real parents or her life or interests. She was just a stand-in for the child the Wheatleys lost. Also, like all alcoholics, Alma was fundamentally selfish. She never saw Beth\u2019s problems right under her nose because she was too busy drowning in her own.\n\nOne thing that really burned me up is that it was adults that introduced Beth to all her addictive habits. Of course, at some point, she became a grownup and had to take responsibility for whether she was going to drink and get high. But, no one was really looking out for her, except Mr. Seibel. That last scene of the school made me cry and I never cry at TV shows or films. But, Beth broke my heart. Mr. Seibel was her real father and the one good parent she had.",

But *everyone* involved always treated it as the limited series it is.\n\nMaking a season 2 now \"just because it's successful\" would be an incredibly bad idea. There are so many examples where having another season withour having it planned from the start goes horribly wrong. Especially with adaptations. Still hurt by the disaster that was Game of Thrones.\n\nWe now have a great story with beginning, middle and *end*. Yes, we like the characters, especially Beth. But her story is told. She achieved what we wanted her to achieve.\n\nBorgov was her biggest opponent. There was never talk about anyone bigger. So magically pull another one out of the hat would ring false. So the chess side of the story is done.\n\nShe had her breakdown with drugs and alcohol and Jolene helped her out of it. So having another breakdown another relapse would destroy that and having it, only for her to get over it again would also ring false. So the drug side of the story is done.\n\nBeth is socially awkward. She wants to fit in, but doesn't know how. She was disappointed early on too many times to really trust anyone but herself. But in the end, the circle of friends she made along the way helped her, despite her being aweful to them (and realizing it). She can finally let her guard down a bit. Having a fallout would again just destroy the happy end we have now. And she would have to \"learn the lesson\" again. No, the social side of the story is also done.\n\nEverything that made the show great is done and was nicely tied up at the end. I might be a bit cynical, but a lot of \"hollywood writing\" is lazy as heck. If there isn't a really *really* good and airtight script with no plotholes from the first season, and if it was really interesting and not just retreading the problems that were already \"solved\", Then I pray to any deity that listenes that they ***don't*** just make a quick cash grab with a second season.\n\nAnd this is how I read her \"maybe\". There could be some script writer, with a much bigger imagination as mine, who might produce a similarily great script. But I really doubt it, because I never saw it happen but I saw a lot of the opposite happen....",

Autistic women often show different symptoms of their diagnosis, like high sensitivity to stimuli, which Beth has throughout the whole show (and is even more obvious in the book). They are really good at masking in general, which causes a late diagnosis for autistic women on average. When they're younger they're a lot worse at masking and so their symptoms are a lot more clear, but when they grow older they become more and more skilled at masking and often seem \"normal\" to others. As an autistic woman myself, I recognize my own symptoms in Beth, both her as a child as well as her as a young woman :)",

Lots of people complained that she looked unrealistically perfect during her breakdown, but for me it was another moment of recognition (as well as for female autistic friends and people online). During my mental breakdowns I love to make it theatrical looking all done up etc. I'm used to seeing myself from an outsider's perspective, as I need to in order to mask and live in neurotypical society, and somewhat enjoy this play despite it being exhausting. I found this well-thought- out response from an autistic woman with addiction and recognise it myself: https://devonprice.medium.com/the-queens-gambit-and-the-beautifully-messy-future-of-autism-on-tv-36a438f63878 \n\nNormally Western media absolutely sucks at representing complex mental health issues but damn this show really hit it all.",

Looking back it explains why he was constantly asking me how I felt about eye contact the first time we met lol. \n\nRegarding Beth; I actually interpreted her being upset at Benny as that she learnt people should be upset when their partner acts that aloof after sex. She grasped this from that time she had sex with Belton (I think that's his name idk the guy lived with her for a while). Till I realized I was autistic and my norms are just very different from others, I'd also just learn what I should get upset at with others, even if it doesn't portray my own feelings. Thus I saw this again as an autistic symptom of hers. I feel like she was a lot more \"natural\" around Townes so I got the vibe they're more a thing than with Benny.",

I'm not sure this would have broad appeal, but being a chess enthusiast myself, I'd certainly watch and, while it's not like watching football or something, I do think the game can be made more cinematic than it was in the first season. Real-life chess masters tend to be hard-edged, often quirky characters, although frequently not as nice as portrayed in the original show, so there is room for additional character development there. \n\nNo doubt there are a lot of good possible narratives a second season could follow on that basis, but FWIW here's mine: Beth plays a world championship match, against a somewhat less sympathetic character than Borgov, perhaps with more explicit Cold War overtones (a la Fischer-Spassky 1972). Builds up a big lead, with the assistance of her chemical friends. Then comes the crash, and she is clearly in bad shape when she loses the match at the end, the loss and the resulting public backlash sends her waaaay down.  That would set up a nice dramatic-comeback arc for the rest of a second season. ATJ has said that she would like to see Beth as a mom, and of course if her comeback happens partly as a result of meeting The Right Guy, that could be added to the dramatic mix.",

This was especially surprising since there was another local woman with whom he was known to be \"keeping company\" (some accounts say this \"mystery woman\" was also watching the game). Shortly after his wife's entrance he made the worst blunder of his career and lost the game, ultimately finishing second in the tournament. \n\nMy guess is that when Beth saw Townes she had what might be called a \"not now, Honey\" moment.",

The 13 year old's hair was much shorter and rather unsophisticated. From 15 on her hair was longer and done in a very popular style.\n\nBut the biggest thing was they hid her bust in the stuff that was supposed to be in 1963. She wore dresses as opposed to blouse/skirt combos. The dresses, especially those in dark colors made her bust less noticeable while the blouses from 1966 onwards tended to do just the opposite.\n\nOne other thing and it might be my imagination. ATJ isn't really short (5'7\") but she is petite. There are several 1963 shots where she is standing next to a guy (c.f. Townes) and I swear that they all must have been 6'+ which makes her look smaller, and by extension younger, in comparison.",

The facilities are in HEAVY use from basketball and seasonal school activities at that time. Sorry, impossible. Add to that those were not great months for travelling in KY in that time period. There was too much of a chance of snow.\n\nThe tournament was held over three days and one of those was a school day. That obviously means school was not in session when they had the tournament . That eliminates anything from the start of classes up thru Thanksgiving and anything after that up to March is just not plausible.\n\nHaving grown up in Lexington I can tell you the most likely time when they could have access to the facilities would have been either during Spring Break which was in March or early April when I was in school. Exactly when was unpredictable because of snow days.\n\nIf you look at what people were wearing it's clear that it wasn't summer or winter. The light coats suggest either Sept-Oct or Mar-Apr. Since Sept-Oct is out that leaves Mar-Apr. \n\nLet's get back to that adoption meeting\n\nShe was in fact 14. She was about to say she would be 15 in November when Helen cut her off. And then of course she suddenly became 13 :) .",

It would indicate that the tournament was after her 20th birthday even though it should have a LOT colder and there very likely would have been snow on the ground if it was still 1968.\n\nMost likely this was a case of filming in Moscow that near X-mas was  a non-starter so the footage is off a little.\n\nIn any case this has nothing to do with she whether was 14 or 15 when adopted.\n\nEDIT: In the book it explicitly states the Moscow tournament was in the summer and that she was 19 so if its November or December that's a change for no apparent reason . I wonder if this might be a second, more believable, pass at the line from the KY tournament i.e., 'How old are you, umm I'm 36 :) '.",

I\u2019m not basing my comments on hypotheticals, I am literally stating what happened in the show. In around 1967 Beth dances to Venus by Shocking Blue, a song that didn\u2019t come out until 1969, the timeline clearly isn\u2019t the most focused upon aspect which is why making assumptions about it is pointless.\n\nThere\u2019s also no proof that she\u2019s about to say \u2018I\u2019m 15 in November\u2019 and from the fact Deardorf says \u2018You have just turned 13\u2019 it seems like this occurs shortly after Beth\u2019s birthday. Orphanages  were more likely to adjust the birth year, not the day. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m convinced she was about to say \u2018I\u2019m 15\u2019, nothing more. If this Kentucky Tournament is in March, as you say, I\u2019m guessing with the time frame she probably would have been adopted in February (allowing time to send and receive Shaibel letters and starting school etc). Why tf would you say \u2018I\u2019m 15 in November\u2019 if it\u2019s 9 months away? I think you\u2019ve read into all of this a bit too much.\n\nAlso it\u2019s Alma that starts to arrange the tournaments after the first one. The Cincinnati one appears to be in December, which we know from the phone calls to the school etc. You really think everyone would be marvelled at her gift, followed by her doing no tournaments or matches for 9 months?",

I have to throw out my point about the 1963 KY tournament time  I went back to the book and lo and behold the tournament was Thanksgiving Weekend (Nov 24-26) which is really sloppy writing. Now the TV writers did not show actual month, day, dates  for the tournament (just year) but there is nothing definite in their script that shows an intent to change the date from the book, so TG it is. It was Tevis who  fricked up on that count.\n\nSo Beth had turned 15 weeks before the tournament. That means for her to be 15 at adoption it had to be in Nov 1963. The Wheatley marriage would have had to blow up in less than 3 weeks. Not believable.\n\nSo it looks to me since school was in session that the adoption was in Sept - mid Oct. 1963 and she was 14. almost 15.\n\nHere's a thought for you. In Deardorff's office Beth was trying to sabotage the adoption by accentuating that she would  be 15 on her next birthday when Deardorff cut her off.",

I didn\u2019t think they meant their physical appearances at first cause the only similarity Beth and Benny have is how they see/think the same. Although them looking rather similar couldn\u2019t just be a coincidence. Anyone know if there\u2019s an interview about this, surely the show-runners must have notice it too. \n\nIf its entirely intentional, then they did a surprisingly good job with casting them, similar enough but different enough to play as lovers, they are both unique looking actors, though still what an odd decision making your love leads looking similar to each other. A matched set, like chess pieces I suppose. \ud83e\udd14 Saw someone said that its like another parallel they shared. Then having Beth fall in love with Benny was almost like her finally loving herself. Her conversation with Cleo in Paris made so much sense in this context now",

We discuss how the cold war started during WWII, espionage, and spy games. Then during the cold war, how academic communication took place, and the similarities with what we saw in the Queen's Gambit. This involves a discussion of Lysenko and Medvedev.\n\nThis video took me a month of editing in spare moments behind my regular lectures, and I reshot it two or three times. There are still a couple of gaffs. I say that Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were the first Americans executed for treason but I should have said espionage. And there is a video glitch near the end that I'll just live with.\n\n(Sorry to post this a second time, the first one didn't catch the thumbnail)",

        "text": "I assume this is an unpopular opinion in this subreddit, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nA couple of caveats before I expand on why I didn\u2019t particularly enjoy the book\n- my knowledge of chess is very limited which did not allow me to fully enjoy a considerable part of the book. This must be an excellent book for chess lovers though.\n- I had very high expectations because I knew the TV series had broken a lot of records and had heard raving reviews.\n\nI didn\u2019t enjoy the book mainly because the story is 100% predictable. Please don\u2019t be offended, but there was no plot. I thought I was reading the most boring and factual biography of a chess player. To me, you could have read chapter 1-4 and 14 and you would have know exactly the same thing about the story.\n\nAfter chapter 4, the book is a combination of the following: Beth studies chess, buys chess books, goes to chess competitions, eats boiled eggs, considers/takes pills, has unexpected and unsatisfying sex, binge drinks, sleeps either very well or very poorly, attends funerals devoid of any emotion and towards the end starts exercising with someone who she had not thought about in the last 7 years of her life. \n\nAlso, there were scenes that did not add anything to the story and seemed to just be there to make the reader uncomfortable or just wonder what the point of the scene was. (E.g.: when Jolene sexually assaulted Beth, when Beth got mad at Benny for playing poker, etc)\n\nFinally, no character seemed to have personality, emotions or development. They were all very much one dimensional. Any of them could have been killed or abducted by aliens and I would have not cared. It\u2019s not that I want extrovert characters or huge events to happen, but I was expecting a level of complexity that was not there. \n\nNegative aspects:\n- repetitive language\n- lack of plot\n- lack of character development \n- no connection between characters or reader with character \n\nPositive aspects: \n- overall well written\n- the beginning and end of the book are interesting \n- it talks about interesting subjects: chess (enjoyed the way it was written) and addiction (poorly written in my opinion)\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s not a terrible book. I think the main problem was that it did not meet my expectations.\n\nI\u2019m considering to watch the TV series, as I\u2019ve read some reviews saying that the story is better told on screen than in paper.",

You'll appreciate the book more after watching the series. >!Prepare for the dialog to be almost verbatim, others a composite of book scenes dramatized or expanded in the series. That's how good the dialog was...!< it wrote itself for the series to put its swirl on. 1982 book-Beth was more a true representation of the era as the Cold War chilled up again. The book Part 2 was in the works but the author died. Fast forward to 2K millennial Beth who is transformed into a superhero with orange hair. Loved the series, but the book has the original DNA that still holds the keys to much of the story's true essence and intentional messaging for the time, like most good books for the ages.",

Zooming in on the 4k footage you can see an unclear red script, and underneath:\n\n TRAVEL SET\n\nPREMIUM LEATHER CHESS SET\n\nWITH WOODEN CHESS MEN  \n\n\nSkipping ahead to 1:00:11 -ish, you get a better view of the red script when Beth put is putting her shopping on the counter. It isn't perfectly clear, but again in 4k with some sharpening you can make out \"Johnson & <something> Co.\" The second word may also start with J - looks like \"Johnson & James\" or \"Johnson & Jones\".  \n\n\nThat doesn't ring a bell so far.  \n\n\nAt 1:01:00, though, you get a very good look at the set. The size, borders, stitching of the board, and the size, stitching and zip of the case all correspond exactly to [this set](https://www.amazon.co.uk/StonKraft-Chess-Genuine-Roll-Up-Leather/dp/B0787W8KCG?ref_=ast_sto_dp) on Amazon. The pieces in that set also match the appearance of the pieces in the set when it shows up again in Moscow at the series' end.  \n\n\nWhat it looks like has happened is that the production team bought that set, carefully unstitched the zip bag from the rest of the board and removed the carry handle, and then re-packaged it in a mocked-up box from an imaginary company. In fact if you single-step the footage from 1:00:54, as Beth unrolls the board, you can zoom in on the 4k and briefly see the two sets of rivet pairs on the back of the board  from where the handle has been detached.  \n\n\nSo, if you want to have a set that is basically the same (apart from the cardboard box), then try to track down the StonKraft.  \n\n\nThis is as far as I've got. If anyone Stateside pipes up and says \"Wait, there was this company Johnson & Bla that did traditional games\" which gives a new lead, awesome. :)\n\nHTH!",

But I've heard so many people complaining about the ending like it's tied up with a neat and pretty bow. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with a happy ending. Why not let her be a champion in something and for it to end well instead of it being ambivalent? She earned it, and it was satisfying. I think some of us have come to see ambivalence/cliff hangers as the tell-tale marks of a good show, while a \"happy ending\" seems to be the easy way out, or something. I loved the ending and was grateful the creator chose to end it that way. Thoughts?",

Revenge on Benny because her relationship with him didn't work out and then on Beth because she became involved with Benny. \n\nWhen she meets Beth the first time, she gives her a backhanded compliment. Like \"You could never be a model.\" but then quickly adding \"You're much too smart.\" She enjoys watching Beth play against Benny and the two other guys and win, because she enjoys seeing Benny humiliated.\n\nIn Paris, she wants to meet with Beth to confirm her suspicions and asks very frankly \"did you like fucking Benny\". Beth gives her the weapon right off when she says she has a big match tomorrow and should be well rested for it. So a night of partying will destroy that and Cleo makes sure that happens. And the next day Cleo is there to watch Beth lose against Borgov. Cleo's revenge on them both is complete. After that she's not seen again.\n\nI know Beth didn't steal Benny from Cleo, but I think in Cleo's mind Beth was the key factor that made sure Benny wouldn't get back together with Cleo.",

We have no real reference or birth year to know how old Townes is. All of them meet Beth when she's around 15, making both Benny and Harry around 23 years old at that point. They're both around 28 by the end of the series.\n\nBeth studies with and has her relationship with Harry when he's about 26 and she's about 18. She studies with and has her relationship with Benny when he's about 27 and she's about 19.\n\nAll of them - Benny, Harry, and Townes - are probably around the same age, to be honest. I get the feeling that a lot of people probably view Townes as older because he has such an obvious interest (attraction or not) in Beth when she's still so young, so I can completely understand why it might come off a little predatory depending on the viewer. Benny and Harry don't really show any major interest in Beth until later in the series when she's a little bit older even if Harry makes it clear that he was just as taken by her when she was 15, enough to get his teeth fixed. Benny claims he doesn't remember meeting her when she was that young, so he probably remembers their first meeting being in Vegas when she's around 18 and he's around 26.",

If I recall, she won her first tournament against Beltic when she was 13.  She was complaining to the twins about how long it would take to get a rating.  Matt (I think) asked her how old she was and she said \u201c13\u201d.  He said she was the youngest person in the room, she could wait four months.\n\nI have to give you the fact that the actors\u2019 appearances don\u2019t necessarily correspond to the age the book said they were.

And Cleo set her up for that, too. (As possibly a Russian spy?)\n\nOr Beth definitely experimenting in different things throughout the show, really as a learning process, her sleeping with Cleo seems likely as a conscious decision.\n\nOne redditor suggested that Cleo was imaginary, and just Beth being bested by her worst self.\n\nWith the 'chess piece' motif, Cleo and Beth are both queens. I'm no pro, but unless one makes bad error, it is hard for a queen to take another queen. Beth certainly was drunk enough to make a mistake, and Cleo looks quite rested and victorious.",

Because thats the insinuation. \n3 there is clearly some tension between cleo and beth during their brief interactions\n\nTheres clearly little romance here but definitely sexual attraction. Cleo had a place to stay so theres no reason for her to be in beths bed unless they slept together. I think the scene would've framed it alot differently had they just been friends sharing a room and i think beth acts around her the way she acts around other people shes shown to be attracted to like townes and benny, the hair touch near cleo i think is a crucial aspect of her clear attraction to the other woman.",

                "comment_text": "Here's my interpretation of what was going on between them. \n\nOn Cleo's side, I believe that she was interested in Beth in a way, but most of everything, she was very jealous of her, you can read that in almost everything she tells her. Cleo, being a model herself, told Beth that she could never be one, not because she wasn't pretty enough (she actually called her beautiful many times which itself was quite flirtatious) but because models are just empty canvases or \"they are whatever you put on them\". To me, it was pretty clear that Cleo thought of herself this way as well, and believed Beth was more than her. Again, when Beth was excitedly dreaming about living in Paris, having fun, and dressing the way Parisian women do, Cleo told her that she would never be like them because she had something they never will: talent. Again this shows that she put her on a pedestal above anyone else including herself. She was also clearly jealous of Benny's interest in Beth which she was never able to gain. She mentioned that no woman could compete with Benny's love for himself but that was obviously not true and both of them knew that, he made it very clear how much he liked Beth and cared about her. \n\nFor Beth, she was definitely interested in Cleo. She made an impression on her in New York, and we have never seen Beth do women friendships just for the sake and fun of it. She got close to Jolene because it was the closest thing to a family they could have in a lonely, dark orphanage, and Beth never contacted even her once she got adopted. The only things Beth showed interest in throughout the show were chess, substances, and love/sex (with an honorable mention to fashion). As Cleo wasn't a chess player, nor was she a substance, it's probably just that Beth was attracted to her. Another thing that leads me to this conclusion is that the only thing that she has ever let distract her from chess was sex/possible relationships and she went out with Cleo the very night before her match with Borgov. Enough said.\n\nCleo actually being very smart, could tell what kind of impression she made on Beth the last time they saw each other, so calling right before her match with Borgov was obviously no coincidence. I believe that Cleo's character was shown as pretty mysterious and manipulative, also quite unstable as we know that she almost committed suicide. In my opinion, she was also feeling bitter and helpless, so she saw a woman who made her feel even less because of her talent, and wanted to take a little something away from her. She pressured Beth to drink, which she very well knew was a weakness of hers, as she stayed with Benny specifically to sober up and study. Personally, I also think that if anyone believed in Beth's talent, it was Cleo. She was aware that this one loss wouldn't hinder Beth's abilities, or her overall success. It was her words \"you will definitely become a champion very soon\". Cleo just wanted to inflict this little wound to have the feeling of power in her hands, the power to take the strength away from a person who has everything you have always wanted to have, even if it's for a little bit. \n\nAs for the hotel room, in my opinion, they slept together. The way the camera ambiguously showed the person in the sheets, leaving it a mystery concerning who it was (because it was implied Beth had the intention to get with one of the men in the hotel) and then surprisingly had Cleo turn around with Beth looking at her with distress right before she hurried out the room. They wouldn't waste screentime on that nor would they do this \"reveal\" thing if it wasn't meant to imply something as the show is never careless with its cinematography and they don't do meaningless scenes. Beth falling asleep in the bathtub was probably a way to make the entire scene more powerful and leave it up to the interpretation since this is more interesting. I see it as her wanting to clean herself after but being very wasted, getting in the bathtub clothed, and falling asleep. \n\nAnother possibility is that they intended to have sex but never got to it since Beth got too drunk.\n\nThis is what I think, obviously, it's just my interpretation but in my opinion this way everything actually makes sense.",

But the entire first episode was carried by a spectacular  performance by Isla Johnston. A breathtakingly subtle portrayal from  such a young actress. Just watch her facial expressions. Many limited  series fail on a weak first episode and if Isla had not been so  compelling who knows if the record viewership would have developed.\n\nHere's  a fun interview with ATJ I hadn't seen before and the only one I've  seen where she mentions Isla.  It's very interesting that she says that  even though she wasn't in the first episode Anya came to watch Isla work  so she understood Beth's full back story. Wish there was a photo of  them together.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDYpRStK50&t=19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDYpRStK50&t=19s)\n\n[Why didn't I get to play white before, you c#&&#37; sucker ?](https://preview.redd.it/l767bmyjf3h61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1d29cf8da88c9dc2f4fda4011a18aa6a513585)",

She went on to watch the entire thing. Of course, a good show is made by team effort and there are dozens of people behind the camera that do the important work. But Miss Johnston is such a young actor, yet she embodied Beth's very complex personality so well. Bravo!",

It\u2019s a cutthroat industry. They spare nobody, not even children with their invasiveness. Just look at Emma Watson, Millie Bobby Brown, and Britney Spears.  In one interview MBB described a fan following her into the bathroom when she was 13. She needed a trained therapy dog to help her manage the anxiety that comes from these types of interactions.",

        "text": "I loved this show so much but 2 things put me off and one of them is Beth's behaviour in some scenes in episodes 5-7.\nBeth as a child was introverted, shy, unconventional and impulsive (tranquilizer addiction). As a teenager it was the same but she became a bit more confident due to her new freedoms and maturity. However when she is becomes older, we can clearly see her behaviour change. She becomes much more confident, extraverted, social, seductive and also somewhat more conventional. \nAs women become more mature I notice that they tend to become more charming, seductive as well as confident (of course not in all cases). Therefore, it's not surprising to me that Beth becomes more like this. However, in some scenes her personality seems completely different (like a different person). For example, when she seduces Beltik it seems like she is so confident and sociable even though she previously wasn't (remember the scene where the girls were singing at the 'party' and she went home). There's some other scenes like in ep 7 when she answers the phone and she is extremely happy about Benny calling. I feel like that behaviour doesn't match her personality. I understand that she would be happy to get a call from Benny, but wouldn't she also be extremely nervous before her tournament? She is usually nervous before them and I can't see how she would be soo excited.\nAnother thing that put me off was when her chaperone in the end of ep 7 said 'you're going to miss your flight!'. Why would they book a flight right after her big match? It doesn't make any sense and it gave me some anxiety lol (like, why doesn't she at least get one more day to meet Townes and spend some time with fans in Russia).",

What I found extremely interesting is that they are calling her (in Russian) \"\u041b\u0438\u0437\u0430\" (\"Liza\"), which is the  English equivalent of \"Lizzie\". Not \u0411\u0435\u0442 (for Beth), not \u042d\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0442 (for Elizabeth), but Lizzie, which is very specific. (\"Look, it's Liza Harmon!\")\n\nNobody called her that way during the whole movie, however if you journey back to the first episode, Beth mentions to her caretaker that only her mother used to call her Lizzie. And guess who's calling her that in the last episode \u2013 it's \"mother Russia\" herself.\n\nI think the director did that on purpose.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Could that mean she found a new family? Personally, after she says \"\u0421\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c\" (Let's play) in good Russian, and seeing her wear all white (aka \"clean slate\"), I almost had no doubt.",

She loves the game, like Mr Shaibel did -- and at first I thought her opponent in the final scene was the same actor.\n\nAnd it's the first time she plays the game for the sheer joy of it instead of trying to win.",

So much so that they went from being a starving agrarian state to being a world power in all of 15 years. Remember that women also had more rights in the USSR. They gained suffrage before Americans, they had legalized abortion in 1920, and they had women working in highly academic fields. They never patronized Beth. They loved her. The Americans never cared for her except as a pawn (no pun intended) to show American grit against \"the big bad Russians.\" The Russians welcomed her in. They recognized her skill and courage.

The only short name to it is \"Liza\" (Lisa). \n\"Beth\" is not an accepted short name for Elizabeth in Russia, since the original name doesn't include \"*beth*\" or anything similar sounding. Calling Harmon \"Beth\" would make most people assume her full name was \"Beth\". I cannot recall exactly, but I guess that they referred to her as Elizabeth while in Russia. \n\nThe older chess player calling her \"Liza\" and especially \"Lizochka\" (which loosely translates to mini-cute-\"Liz\") is them being very friendly, loving and paternal. Older people in Russia almost never refer to their siblings by their full names and very often use the \"mini-cute-\" suffixes even when the children don't like it.\n\np.s.\nname <> short name translation is actually pretty complicated. As I was typing this I realized that there are multiple cases for using a name like Elizabeth in Russia:\n\n\u042d\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0442 (E-liza-bet) - literal transliteration of the name Elizabeth. Russian language doesn't have \"th\" sound.\n\n\u0411\u0435\u0442 (Bet) - transliteration of Beth. Would be assumed as a standalone name name by most Russians.\n\n\u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (E-lisa-veta) - russian equivalent of the name.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u0437\u0430 (Liza) - closest pronunciation of Lisa. Would be assumed as a short name of Elisaveta by most.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u0437 (Liz) - would be assumed a standalone name by most.",

That said, a lot of time has past and I don't think you should vilify someone who has changed. \n\nMy point was and still is: the show didn't show the reality of professional chess, neither in the 60s or at least until the 2002 and presumably some time after.",

The classic eyeliner in the 60\u2019s and what is shown in the show is a straight line that does not follow the contour of the eye. This is most visible when the eyes are closed or viewed in profile. When viewed dead on the liner has a winged appearance because of the curve of the eye.\n\n\nEdit to add: I am a licensed cosmetologist and have worked as a makeup artist. These screen caps show what I mean. You can see the line does not follow the outer portion of the lash line and flick up, but rather it follows the inner part of the lash line and then continues on in a straight line \n\nhttps://anyataylorjoy.net/photos/albums/uploads/Television/2020-QueensGambit/S1/Captures/106/SATJ106-748.jpg\n\nhttps://anyataylorjoy.net/photos/albums/uploads/Television/2020-QueensGambit/S1/Captures/106/SATJ106-747.jpg",

But enough geeking out, if you're interested, please feel free to check this episode out, or even our other episodes if they strike your fancy! We talk trivia, tv/book differences, questions, and even hilariously bad Letterboxd reviews, all with improvisational comedy. I hope you like it!\n\nThanks!\n\n[Episode 17, The Queen's Gambit](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e17-the-queens-gambit/id1535697670?i=1000507022964)",

I saw that women chess players were regarded as \"trained dogs\" by some. That said, maybe it would be distracting from Beth's inner turmoil if the show actually delved into the reality of all this. \n\nI'm really glad that my posts about historical women of chess don't yet seem to be annoying people (maybe I'll do a pole in a week) but I think its really important to transfer the enthusiasm for the show into learning about the real people and the real context.",

        "text": "Like any good novelist, Walter Tevis created characters using composites of various people, as well as his own imagination. But is has long been obvious who the main inspiration for Beth Harmon was. In a recent article for Chess.com, \"Batgirl\" (aka Sarah Beth) outlines the parallels large and small with Diana Lanni, one of the strongest US womens chess players of the 1970s and early 1980s and a woman who Walter Tevis knew well: [https://www.chess.com/article/view/beth-harmon-the-isolanni](https://www.chess.com/article/view/beth-harmon-the-isolanni) . I also greatly enjoyed the interview Lanni gave to chess and poker journalist Jennifer Shahade, available here: [https://thepokergrid.com/2020/12/24/the-grid-051-5-bonus-episode-ft-diana-lanni/](https://thepokergrid.com/2020/12/24/the-grid-051-5-bonus-episode-ft-diana-lanni/) . Now in her 60s, Lanni still plays online occasionally for fun at [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) as \"Lana Caprini\": [https://www.chess.com/member/lanacaprini](https://www.chess.com/member/lanacaprini) .\n\nThe parallels are of course not exact. Lanni did not go as far in the game (she gave up over-the-board chess after being defrauded out of her master title), and has had an even rougher life than the Beth Harmon character (the TV version, anyway).  She eventually pulled herself together, after a stay in a mental institution and at least one in jail, to which she partly credits chess, in a quote that could have come straight from Beth:  *\u201cThe logic of chess was an alternative system to the chaos of life. \\[...\\] It\u2019s an entire world of just 64 squares. I feel safe in it. I can control it. I can dominate it. And it\u2019s predictable, so if I get hurt, I only have myself to blame.\u201d*   As Sarah Beth says, that is no doubt the most satisfying part of Lanni's story.",

There were some beautiful women of chess, and I'll continue to post them here, but the real heavy weight female chess players of that era were from the USSR (and really within that, Georgia). Lane was unique in America in this respect. She thought of her beauty and charm as a means of driving up interest in chess. [Watch this TV appearance of her here](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensgambit/comments/lccy0i/lisa_lane_the_possible_inspiration_for_beth/): \n\n> \"*I'm the most important American chess player. People will be attracted to the game by a young, pretty girl. That's why chess should support me. I'm bringing it publicity and, ultimately, money.\"*\n\nSo while it isn't true that Lane grew up in an Orphanage for her entire childhood \"for a time, her mother was forced to keep Lisa in an orphanage and a home for fatherless girls*\"*, it was a myth circulating that she felt the need to correct:\n\n> \"*I never knew my father. It isn't true that I grew up in an orphanage. My mother worked, and my sister and I boarded with different families while we went to school. We lived with my grandmother in Wyndmoor.*\"",

Walter clearly read around the chess world of this time enough to mention Nona Gaprindashvii, who was involved in the same competitions as Lane. \n\nLane's self appointed role as a figure head of chess would indicate further visibility, especially given her friendship with Bobby Fischer and the fact that this post was drawing from photos of a Sports Illustrated magazine on which Lane featured on the cover. She also set up a women's chess school in New York called Queen\u2019s Pawn Chess Emporium.\n\nAll theories are fine and I've decided to make an effort to post more about female chess players with the flair \"Women of Chess\" and cross posting them to the chess subreddit where apparently any photo of Karpov will be upvoted a few hundred times but \"Women's Grandmaster\" will be downvoted to oblivion with unwarranted explanations about how it isn't a real title and how it simultaneously isn't sexist.

I finished it recently and wanted to talk about it with other fans about what parts/characters were excluded or added to the show from the original source material. \n\n\n*****Spoilers below for the book*****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest surprise for me was Beth\u2019s sexual abuse as a child. It really changed how I viewed Beth and Jolene\u2019s relationship. I was glad it was excluded from the show because it made me see Jolene in a negative light.\n\nAnother surprise was Townes role. In the show, their \u201cromance\u201d was given a lot of attention. But in the book, all it is is Beth\u2019s first crush. She does go to his hotel room to play chess and have her photo taken but there is no other \u201cpartner\u201d there and he never visits her in Moscow. \n\nLastly, Cleo! Beth never sees her in Paris and they never have a wild night out. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts about other characters/situations you noticed or anything else that surprised you",

I like the addition of her being in her mother\u2019s car during the accident. It was a substitution for the sexual assault/trauma (plus seeing her parents relationship) and made her journey feel more justified in my opinion. \n\nIt was strange to me that in the book she wasn\u2019t really an addict the same way she was in the show. She\u2019s pretty mature and responsible for her actions in the book, but in the show she\u2019s kinda off the rails with the pills. It\u2019s right for the show, I was just surprised when I read the book and it was very different. \n\nI was surprised that she played Borgov early on in the book, and I\u2019m glad they lead up to Paris and Moscow in the show without her playing him in Mexico City. \n\nI felt personally that the Townes and Cleo additions in the show really improved the character depth. It feels nice as a non-straight person ( \ud83d\ude02) to see films/shows set in a different time period and make it feel okay to not be straight. They didn\u2019t make it weird, they normalized it and I think in this day and age it\u2019s about time we included it in film/tv without making it a huge deal/the entire plot. \n\nI genuinely think it was a near perfect adaptation even considering the changes. I was very happy to see the dialogue is basically word for word.\n\n Oh, also I was super glad they gave Alma Wheatley her last piano moment in Mexico. It was a beautiful moment and I really appreciated the slight change that made her death feel more complete and less abrupt.",

The general gist of it is: this should be teached as a master class in how to adapt stories from one medium to another. The show is immensly faithful to the book down to seemingly irrelevant details (penis candle; flame decal on Beltiks car). \n\nUp to Paris it's basically scene for scene. And after that it's mostly some rearrangement of scenes. Very little changes. Some good (Beths hair being red instead of brown), some... debatable (Cleo in Paris), but nothing that really hurt the original, like some other adaptations do to theirs (Eragon, Artemis Fowl... most young adult novels actually...)\n\nYou feel how everyone involved loved the book and wanted to bring it to life as good as possible. It's not just a quick cash grab because of some brand recognition. It's an almost 40 year old story. There were no \"higher ups\" that demanded weird changes. They had the freedom of both Netflix and having seven episodes to tell the full story instead of having to cram it into a movie.",

I also thought it was kinda odd for him to show up in Russia because he only interacted with Beth at the KSC and in Vegas. However, I do see why they wanted to have someone in Russia for Beth to talk to. It\u2019s a show after all and you can\u2019t narrate thoughts like in the book so you need dialogue.

This scene is not realistic, nor taken from the book. I think it was made this way just to capture the viewer's attention, let's present an eccentric character (lives a cool lifestyle, cool looking and doesn't care that everyone waits for her). That's precise description of Beth, right?   \n\n\n2) Show Beth is so aggressive: she pushed the girls when \"apple pie\" girls were marching trough corridor; she called Mr. Shaibel \"cocksucker\" after loosing; she was so bitter and snide while playing vs Beltik   \n\n\n3) Show doesn't explain why she uses the tranquilisers, it doesn't explain her relationship with them. In the show \"pills\" are drugs, she tried them and got addicted. Why? Because these are drugs and everyone gets addicted to them, end of story. While in the book, the author describes her insecurities, how she felt uncomfortable in the new place, she could not sleep, she was literally staring at the celling all night. She was saving the pills for the night because it was the only way for her to \"get rid of that tension in her tommy\", relax and sleep.  \n\n\n4) I am confused about the deviation from the book:  \n\\- Why did they introduced mother's past? Made her a doctor in math? Decided that mother should suicide - \"close your eyes\"...  \n\\- Added more \"artistic flavour\" to Mrs Wheatley - made her a pianist. To give her a valid reason to stay home all day?   \n\\- What was the point to lie about her age (when she was adopted)?  \n\\- Removed the sexual scene with Jolene. Mrs Deardorff was helping Beth. Why? To make this characters \"likeable\", even it doesn't fit them?  \n\n\nI am not against adapting books and making movies, but it feels uncomfortable to watch the show called \"The Queen's Gambit\" suggesting it is from the book \"The Queen's Gambit\", yet they are so different. If instead, the show would be called something else or be \"inspired by the book\", I feel the author would have valid reasons to change the characters, as he pleases.  Maybe my \"issue\" is that I read the book 1st, have successfully created the world in my head, and THEN saw the show. It surely looked different and also unrealistic. It feels very different and so distant. I read your comments, happy to know other people liked it, even people that read the book. In the show, the Beth is more of a \"pop\" style, easily winning against any opponent. Why? Because her mother has a book in math, because Beth is genius and because she takes pills. To make it better, they added a \"cowboy\" that spends nights by clubbing and play a bit of chess during the day. Does this make sense to you?",

That showed that she isn't \"perfect\" at chess once again (people are somehow angry that Beth \"always wins\"...) further establishes Borgov as the most powerful opponent at the time and it creates drama, as Beth now questions herself if she is even good enough. \n\nIn the show, the only drama is \"if she only didn't go with Cleo, she might've won then and there\". Which would be just as easy a \"blame Cleo\" as the plethora of fan theories that Cleo is KGB... \n\nThe story doesn't need it and IMHO works better without it.

He was a champion back then, and I originally perceived him to be an arrogant, kind of rude man based on the way he seemingly looked down on Beth. I did not even think he would be a prominent character, just one of the people who would be proven wrong in undermining her.\n\nSo when he called her up episodes later, volunteering to help and support her, I was astounded and for a moment even doubted his intentions. Yet his character has taken a complete turn from the man he used to be \u2014 in fact he became one of the purest, kindest souls in the series! I felt really bad for him because he did nothing but care about Beth, regardless of how she treated him. He had been faithful and respected her so much until the end.\n\nIt would have been really lovely if he and Beth had a proper reconciliation in the series. I think he deserves better, and I am a sucker for Beth and Benny's chemistry, but there is no denying that he was the best among everyone else with whom she is being shipped.",

I do think that his crush on her started when they were at the KY state championship, there was a shot where he sees her and kind of smiles. \n\nHarry Mellings description of his story arch is pretty interesting as well. He has said several times that Harry is a kid when he played Beth. His being around the same age as Beth makes a lot of his behavior make a lot more sense. \n\nAnd while I also think Benny and Beths chemistry was great, I also thought that Beths reaction when she hears him on the phone was sweet. She didn\u2019t tear up with Benny, but with him. That and the fact that he\u2019s a ride or die is why I will always ship him with Beth.",

Beth puts the piece in her bag, as she leaves an unknown person whispers in her ear \"look inside the queen\". Later in hotel room she unscrews the bottom of the chess piece and finds a message from Brogov stating that he wants to defect and asks for her and U.S help to seek for an asylum.\n\nBeth is conflicted, as she likes to stay away from politics, yet hands over the note to the American security person. Then back home we see her talking to her friends: \"Now, I will never be sure. Did I really win? Or did Borgov lose on purpose to hand over that chess piece to me?\"",

Not every non-westerner wants to become a westerner/American, especially top competitors of culturally popular sports and games in their own countries. Soviet Russia was a perfectly good place to be a white, Russian, chess grandmaster. Russian culture has always treated chess players very well and you can bet Borgov would have been decently nationalistic and happy to compete for his country. Borgov would also have not lost to Beth on purpose because throwing to an American grandmaster would have gotten him punished severely by the Soviet regime.",

It would have built up on the theme of how much this kind of fame really wears on someone and that maybe he was more like beth than he let on. This was his way of leaving. He lost to get out of the public eye to retire and write books on chess. I think it would have achieved the same goal and kept in with themes of the show. I think it would have made more sense if it turned out that he was having his own problems as he's been playing chess for decades and wants to do something else with his life. instead ending with them playing in a chess club for fun as he explains why he did it, that he didn't have problems with drugs or drinking but it took a toll on him not being able to hold stable relationships outside of chess and his constant playing of it. It just ends with them playing the game and no winner shown. It becomes less about who wins in the end but the love of the game.",

So, yes, world class, top of their field chess players, could ultimately make serious money, but during the fictional Benny Watts mid 60's era, the prize money was still small.Even Spassky received only the equivalent of $1400 for his 1969 world win.",

        "text": "I appreciated them doing this portrayal of a person who became an addict as a kid. That\u2019s what happened to me. I was prescribed adderall for a while, and I\u2019d crush and snort it at my friend\u2019s recommendation. I found a huge stash of adderall in my mom\u2019s bedroom closet (from before they became super strict about giving people that much at once). She hardly used them and for two years or so I\u2019d go up to her bedroom and sneak handful of the little pills. \n\n\nEdit: and I didn\u2019t use adderall to play chess, but I did do it to write! I wrote incredibly well on them back then. Now most of my creativity has gone out the window. But back then, I\u2019d crush the pills  and stay in my room, writing for hours, days in a row, doing lines. I felt like Stephen King haha.\n\n\nEdit 2: I realize Beth took tranquilizers and wasn\u2019t a regular at the amphitheater, but drugs are drugs.\n\n\nAs an adult now, alcohol and amphetamine are both reoccurring themes in my life. I\u2019ve accepted that they always will be to an extent. Like Beth, I can go without the pills for years but as soon as I come across them (or speed/amphetamine paste) it\u2019s like I\u2019m reunited with an old lover and we do this wild dance for a bit before losing touch. \n\n\n\nJust thought I\u2019d share my story. I\u2019m shocked at how relatable Beth is! This sub isn\u2019t superbusy so I figure this content is okay right?",

                "comment_text": "Beth was addicted to a benzo called Librium, similar to Xanax, Valium, or Ativan. They usually treat anxiety or insomnia which is why they\u2019re called tranquilizers. It\u2019s actually quite dangerous because they can be deadly when combined with alcohol. It can cause central nervous and immune system failure which would lead to massive organ damage and death. A lot of people die from respiratory failure since they both slow your heart rate so much.\n\nSeeing as how it was back in the 50-60\u2019s I can sort of get how they got away with giving such hardcore drugs to kids because there were little to no restrictions compared to what we have today in pharmacies. They practically handed that stuff out like candy! Benzos are a schedule 4 substance and amphetamines are schedule 2. The higher the drug schedule, the more restrictions are placed on them. Schedule 2\u2019s are pretty much the most \u201chardcore\u201d drugs you can legally get with a prescription.\n\nAt the same time, they also treated amphetamines like candy back then too. Very little restrictions on adhd meds compared to nowadays.  Amphetamines are also pretty dangerous with alcohol. They interact in a way that makes it harder to tell when you\u2019ve had too much to drink. This can lead to severe alcohol poisoning or strokes. They\u2019re stimulants so pretty much the opposite of benzos.\n\nBoth can be very addictive when they are abused. Benzos tend to have pretty severe withdrawal effects in the way Beth took them, whereas most stimulants are able to be stopped at will depending on how much/often you take them. It\u2019s also much easier to OD on benzos. She should\u2019ve been dead in that scene where she shoveled them into her mouth at 9 yrs old lol. \n\nSource: I work in a pharmacy and I have adhd and I\u2019ve been on benzos and I just like drugs a lot in general \ud83d\ude0e",

It\u2019s almost impossible to abuse it as you\u2019ll have a bad time taking it often in a row, since all it does is deplete your serotonin reserve. There\u2019s only so much of it to empty. Same with other psychedelics. These aren\u2019t drugs that are habit forming, like speed is. Speed/amphie pills aren\u2019t fun for a lot of people either. They\u2019re difficult to understand and easy to abuse and I\u2019ve known a lot of people that went absolutely balls to the walls crazy on them. If you aren\u2019t familiar with them, I recommend against using them. Once you add them to your repertoire, they become like coffee: something you crave because you want the energy that comes with it. People who use speed + alcohol a lot, will find themselves falling asleep with only alcohol, and resort to speed more and more often, which is terrible for your heart and I guess several other organs and orifices...\n\n\n*which I did ONCE and hated and I was sooo terrified for days.

What I meant to say is that it can be dangerous to take it too often because you run the serious risk of relying on it to restore your dopamine/seratonin. One of my best friends used to take it once a week and eventually started having severe depression when she stopped taking it because there was no other way to restore those neurotransmitters otherwise (big words that I\u2019m probably not explaining well because I just woke up). \n\nI still wouldn\u2019t consider it a psychedelic personally. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE mdma and I\u2019ve had some of the best nights of my life when I\u2019ve taken it, but that\u2019s always because I\u2019ve prepared well for it and took the necessary steps to recover during the comedown. It\u2019s not something I would recommend to people that only have sketchy sources available. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like any psychedelic I\u2019ve taken personally, but I guess some people might find it comparable. I\u2019ve actually read some really cool studies where people with treatment-resistant depression and PTSD were given mdma and had sessions with a therapist during their rolls, and it was very effective for a lot of them. I think that my only real problem is that people have to make sure that their sources are trustworthy and they research it before using it (like every drug.)

These are the reasons why I\u2019ve come to be obsessed with this show, along with moments I wish the writers handled better. \n\nWell first off, I love any series that has a badass, independent, competitive, female lead.\nI love Beth\u2019s storyline and progression.\nI love how Beth triumphs over her own worst enemy, herself. \nI love Beth\u2019s evolution in fashion.\nI love Beth\u2019s cockiness. \nI love how Alma grows into motherhood.\nI love how Beth literally had almost nothing and fought her way into a comfortable lifestyle. \nI love how the women (Beth, mostly & Alma) refuse to let a man dictate their lives.\nI love Beth\u2019s curiousness in sexuality. \nI love Beth\u2019s intelligence and willingness to continue learning.\nI love Beth\u2019s unwillingness to settle into the traditional female roles.\nI love how the women, even in the 60s, drank \nbeer.\nI love Beth and Cleo\u2019s relationship.\nI love how Cleo is aware of her position in the world and sees how important Beth\u2019s position \nis for a woman.\nI love Cleo\u2019s truthfulness and straightforwardness. \nI love the set design and attention to detail.\nI love how Beth honors Alma after she passes (not always in the best ways): Gibson\u2019s, cigarettes, her night robe, her fuzzy heels, her lipstick choices.\nI love Beth and Benny\u2019s at first competitive, nemesis-like relationship that grows into a mentorship and later a relationship. \nI love how all the men in the show are willing to admit defeat (not always graciously), but even Benny.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like:\n\nHow Cleo knew the Paris Final was important to Beth but tempted her to get drinks. \nHow the writers only gave Jolene so much screen time after so many years.\nHow Shaibel & Alma die and are not there to see Beth become World Champ and a Grandmaster. \n\nLet me know what you liked & disliked about the limited series!",

                "comment_text": ">How Cleo knew the Paris Final was important to Beth but tempted her to get drinks. \n\nThere's an element to this interaction which I don't think anyone else has pointed out, and which actually seems to run throughout the show.\n\nWhen Cleo calls up from the lobby, Beth answers wearing a big **white** sweater; she is in control, takes the lead in refusing Cleo. When she comes down, she's wearing dark red (red is one of the most common alternatives to simple black in chess sets) - she's gone passive, surrendered the initiative to Cleo.\n\nThere are several scenes which follow the same pattern - one character wears white and takes the lead, makes the first move or is in control while the other, wearing black or dark colors, passively follows or is incapable of making the first move. Where both characters wear black, you get scenes where nothing happens, neither can make the first move. It happens a lot in Beth and Harry's summer together at her place, they're both dressed in black and hence passive most of the time. When Beth dances to Fever, she does so after removing a dark top to reveal a white shirt; Harry looks stunned at her change of role - he knows he should make a move, but can't because he's wearing black. When Harry finally does kiss Beth, he's wearing white - as he is later when he starts a big speech about his feelings for Beth only to get shut down.\n\nIn Townes' hotel room - again we see a character change color - Townes takes off a black sweater to reveal a white shirt; Beth looks as shocked as Harry will later; does she now anticipate him making a move? And while we're here - why is Roger wearing green? A color which tends to signal unhealthy addiction on Beth.\n\nThere is one obvious exception to this rule - Benny always wears black, so doesn't follow the rule at all. And it's not quite 100% consistent - when Harry moves out, he's in black, Beth white. But, as far as I am aware the only scene where two characters both wearing white interact is the racquetball game which, of course, isn't chess, so different rules apply.",

First of all, I appreciated how little tropes they used in the show. Even some seemingly apparent tropes become less obvious with deeper analysis, like the orphanage. At first glance it seems like an awful place but you're seeing it from 9yr Beth's perspective. It wasn't a great childhood but none of the people who worked there has ill intent or acted maliciously towards Beth or anyone else there. It seemed like a group of flawed individuals tasked with the impossible task of caring for orphans who were going to be unhappy no matter what. I can't imagine anyone working there didn't genuinely care for the girls, despite some questionable methods.\n\nThis also translates to the characters as well. There is no villain. All of the characters are flawed but human, and none of them act maliciously to Beth (besides Margret and her step-dad, but they remain complex characters). I also appreciate how the writers trick the viewers into assuming something bad will happen because we are so used to shitty overused tropes. The show reminds us that life is complex and most people are just trying to make it through the struggle. \n\nYou did a good job highlighting how strong Beth is as a character and this is one of the main things that has drawn me to her. I love strong female characters, not because it's unusual for women to be strong but because it's unusual for them to be portrayed as strong, and I liked Harry for the same reason - it's unusual to see male characters be portrayed as vulnerable. I suppose I'm also very attracted to strong, stubborn redheaded women so....\n\nI related to Beth quite a bit, but I found that her strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa - I find that I can learn from her without learning from a caricature of a perfect human. She feels like a real person with real strengths and weaknesses. It's way better than trying to learn how to be superman or some shit like that. Things like her confidence, the strong eye contact that she (and others) make, her fearlessness (telling the church ladies to fuck off), how she combines elegance and intelligence to become absolutely intoxicating to watch.\n\nAlso the other aspects of the show are very well done. The set design and costumes are breathtaking, and there is a purpose to the cinematography that you rarely see in television. Somehow they found a way to make chess sexy, and not dramatized, unrealistic chess, but realistic normal chess. I think the format helps - 7 episodes is enough time to create a fully-fleshed out story (it's like a trilogy) but they have the time to devote to each episode that they would not have in a typical television format.\n\nI've never been obsessed over a show like this, or any literature for this matter besides Harry Potter when I was a teen. I watch this show every day and I don't see myself stopping soon.",

She is the only villain in the story, and it makes for an incredibly realistic show. How often do we meet true villains in real life? People are complex and usually some shade of gray, but true villains are rare; we often do it to ourselves.\n\nOf course Beth isn't at fault for her childhood, being put into an orphanage etc. But there isn't a true villain here, she is experiencing the suffering that is life and finds a way to pull herself out of it with the help of her friends. I can relate to this so much more than to some evil character subjecting poor Beth who has no free will at all. Refreshing.\n\nEdit: I kinda ignored your point. I think its great that they strayed from lazy writing that makes a character good because other characters are bad. The *men bad trope* is so overused - how often do you see a male character in conflict with evil women? It's usually a strong female or male lead pitted against evil men, and its fucking boring.",

I think that often times being in a management role comes with a hard, stern personality to keep things in tact. Luckily, I also bring in those aspects as a position that aren\u2019t always viewed as feminine. Like Beth, I don\u2019t let male dominance affect me.

        "text": "So, to preface this I have no experience in an orphanage, foster care, or similar. But, I noticed I found myself realizing watching the Queen's Gambit how deeply confused I was by all the orphanage tropes you've seen in cinema from Matilda to QG. \n\nLike - why are these girls not going to school? It's the not the 1700s, we have buses. Why aren't the kids going to the local public schools with the orphanage as a boarding school dorm? Was the limited, shitty, all ages together (Jolene and Beth are in the same literature class, and it's not because the staff at the orphanage is having Beth take advanced classes...) education they are getting normal then? Ever? \n\nWhy is it that the people working at the orphanages feel so borderline bitter. Like - you see this over and over again as a trope. They treat the kids like it's kind of their fault, more like mental patients than kids at a boarding school. It's like Harry Potter Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\*. Is that documented from the period? \n\n\\*which, shitty mental hospitals and victim blaming mentally ill people is a whole other discussion.\n\nBasically, why is it that every portrayal of orphanages you encounter is shitty. Were there really no 1900-1980 era orphanages that were just - a boarding school for kids without parents plus probably some therapists because everyone here has had an unfairly shitty life so far? How bloody hard is that?\n\nAnd lastly - if that kind of system could exist - why is it that most child services has far less accountable foster care systems that I know are riddled with nightmare parents, scammers, etc. Why wasn't like - unfortunate Harry Potter the model for child services for orphans and children from homes the court deems unsafe the model? Especially in Britain and Europe where the boarding school model would immediately come to mind for those in positions of power and responsibility. \n\nI just...don't get it, and would love to see a discussion about the issues raised and for people who do social work to educate us all on why things are the way they are, and how hard it is to make them better.",

If they get abused, who is going to vouch for them? Their parents lol? Other orphans in that orphanages? They have very little agency in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI'm not too familiar with boarding schools but generally I associate them with rich people. Have you seen American teacher pay? Sure a publically funded boarding school in the affluent neighborhoods wouldn't be bad but the poor neighborhoods boarding schools would have the kids living under a bridge in a cardboard box. \n\nI think if we were to breakdown the cost of orphanages and foster care, orphanages are cheaper to run in the short term. The \"staff\" to children ratio is pretty bad compared to the foster system. Countries who opt for orphanages are trying to save money. I'm sure looking after children with very agency attracts certain type of people to work in orphanages. Similar to how Catholic priests are often predatory gays.\n\nThe staff to children ratio creates a lot of behavioral problems. Many in orphanages develop attachment disorders. Russian and eastern European orphans are notorious for being aggressive and having attachment issues. A few Americans landed in the headlines for sending their children back to their country of origin. Not every orphanage fosters such extreme behavior issue but I imagine even the decent ones foster mild problems. Imagine trying to integrate kids with family and institutionalized kids. The disparity in their lifestyle alone is extreme (holidays, personal bedrooms). I don't think either type of children are mentally mature enough to handle the differences. There would be a lot of resentment and discrimination on both sides. I look at poor askreddit threads and kids parents already discriminate other children living in trailers. I doubt parents want their kids going to school with orphans or at least the nice area schools. \n\nBesides the sedating of the children, Beth's orphanage is pretty good tbh. Maybe if my orphanage had enough money to buy drugs, they would've sedated us too lol (for reference, I was stunted in height due to malnutrition) . Most developed countries have phased out of orphanages because of the long term issues out causes (foster care isn't perfect either). Look into foreign orphanages accounts (Russia, Ukraine, 90s China). They make Beth's orphanage look like Disney world.",

Yes it was a 1 room school but those can give a decent (not great) education if they make the effort.\n\nThe original system for orphans was to foster/apprentice them. That system began to break down after the civil war.  At that point the churches became involved, especially from the 1880'son. I don't think there was anything serious from the state before Roosevelt's took over in 1932 beyond inspections. The decisions such as they were would have solely been at the county level. Any system for Child Welfare at the state level would have been new (post WW II) and probably not too swift.\n\nOf the remaining orphanages today,20 are church based and 8 are not. All but four are found in either Lexington, Louisville, or Covington/Newport.\n\nBy the by, the tranquilizer thing actually happened. I looked it up and was shocked.",

She's a real person and the first female Grandmaster, you know, she deserves respect. \n\n> [Grandmaster Mikhail Tal], in his autobiography, tells a story of their game in Reykjavik in 1964. Not wishing to win on time in his winning endgame, Tal would occasionally not press his clock after moving. Gaprindashvili caught onto him and confirmed her sporting nature by telling him she would resign immediately if he continued to go easy on her.\n\nhttps://www.chess.com/players/nona-gaprindashvili",

Apparently the pink/purple breakup hair was a pain to do, whoopsie...\n\nI had virgin baby hair and was the last of my friends to ever dye my hair but started my sophomore year of college with 7R dye and that was it for me - forever red, still at 36... None of my (non-childhood) friends even believe me when I tell them I'm not naturally a redhead. lol...why would I lie? but when I say, \"no, really\" they say, \"well, a mistake was made because you look amazing and totally right as a redhead...\" I wish I was bold enough to go this short bc my hair is so heavy atm but it looks **super** lovely on you!

        "created": "2021-01-30 22:14:49",
        "text": " I was puzzled when I saw Beth Harmon overwhelmingly typed as an INTJ, because she doesn\u2019t seem anything remotely like an INTJ \u2013 her entire nature screams INTP to me and I will attempt to explain why.\n\nFirst of all, we should consider why she is typed as an INTJ \u2013 it seems mostly to do with her \u201cintuitive\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d nature, emotional coolness, and the stereotype that chess players are J\u2019s.\n\nIntuition in chess isn\u2019t some magical thing that someone with strong Ni would have - Chess intuition comes from an incredible understanding of the game and a solid framework for making decisions. Remember, Harmon doesn\u2019t like memorizing strategies or studying players she doesn\u2019t like. She has a unique aggressive playstyle, and when she is encouraged to study players that conflict with her framework for playing (Ti) she fights back. If she was Te, she would be studying and memorizing as many strategies as possible, from all the great players. To me, this points to Ti, especially as she is bored by standard, logical play. I can\u2019t imagine a Te user would pass up making the best move in order to keep things interesting.\n\nWhen Beth says \u201csometimes the moves just come to me\u201d, she doesn\u2019t mean that an idea for a move just pops into her head without her knowing why; she means that she can recognize and understand a line of play instantly. This is because her understanding of the game (Ti) is so developed that she has effectively \u201cbackloaded\u201d her thinking \u2013 she has spent so much time reading about chess and visualizing scenarios that she can look at a board and find moves others can\u2019t, without spending 20 minutes working through each possibility. As a heavy Ti user I can relate: on subjects I understand the most, I don\u2019t need to *think* to make decisions because I have spent so much time building up frameworks in my head that when the time comes, my judging function works instantly. The other side of the coin is that I can seem dumb with subjects that I don\u2019t have experience with because the framework is not developed, and I need a lot of time to work it out. \n\nOutside of chess, I never get the sense that she is inclined towards J rather than P. Although her fashion tastes are *on trend*, she never seems bothered by Benny\u2019s eccentric fashion and has no interest in being conventional. She is stubborn when it comes to her interests (chess), but goes with the flow with everything else \u2013 for example, partying with the stoners, moving to NYC to live with a guy she barely knows, letting Harry stay with her, etc. And although she is obsessed with chess, she is indecisive about her future in it, not knowing if she wants to compete in Paris or Moscow. \n\nShe also seems like a typical INTP emotionally \u2013 she keeps it bottled up until she loses, and then explodes. I can relate, I even do the exact same rage-laugh she does when she loses to Borgov and Benny. \n\nShe is colder than most INTP\u2019s but I think that can be due to her childhood trauma, she develops trust issues which she resolves over time. She is much warmer and friendly in Moscow than she is in the beginning of the show. \n\nAnyways, let me know if you agree/disagree with me on this one. Clearly INTP\u2019s and INTJ\u2019s are alike in many ways, so it\u2019s not surprising people see different things in her.",

And so it could basically be the same show with a different addiction rather than chess and I think it'd be equally as interesting. Maybe I missed it but although I know some about chess the show added nothing to my knowledge, and I'm glad the route it went with. I'm just telling you this so some chess nerds or people who really liked the show don't bully you for thinking you have knowledge because of this show. And I'm just bored",

        "text": "Lately, there's a lot of rumors of making the second season of the show, and honestly, I hope they don't do it.\n\nFirst of all, I enjoyed this show more than any other. It's the best miniseries I've ever seen. I already watched it multiple times and planning to rewatch it again and again.\n\nNow, that being said, why wouldn't I want to see the second season of this amazing show? Well, for starters, I don't think that things should be forced to have sequels in any form just because the first part/season was a huge success, and this was meant to be just that - miniseries of 7 episodes. The show has been made according to the book, and it ended with the book. If they make 2nd season, I'm very afraid that it would be ruined because someone was greedy to make even more money, while has absolutely no clue what would Walter Tevis think of it, and would even write it if he lived long enough. Being an author myself, I really hate when movies or shows ruin books, but I digress.\n\nI have no doubt that the acting crew would remain marvelous, but I doubt the quality of the story. I really felt that the 7th episode was closure for Beth, and wouldn't want to see how they ruin it. Also, one of my greatest worries is that they make her someone's girlfriend or wife. I don't think she should be with someone, she's not that kind of person - that needs someone by her side (romantically), and I honestly hope she stays the way we left her, which is single, sober, and happy.\n\nOf course, if they make another season, I'll watch it, but I doubt it's gonna be this amazing. It's mine to doubt, and it's theirs to prove me wrong. But considering I'm a huge fan of many great franchises, I've witnessed so many times how they turned amazing stories to junk, so that's where my concern came from.",

Which means only a portion of the show took place in present day. \n\nThat means they don't have to just explore the future, but they can explore the past as well. And it won't seem out of place, in fact it would be very much similar in style to season 1. \n\nIf they explore more of Beth's in between years, and her other games along the way to face Borgov, and then pick up in present day to show what happens after Borgov, I think we would have a season 2 that is very similar to season 1 without destroying what made the show so great.",

The Kentucky State Championship: The scenes between the twins and Beth (the twins also featured in Scott Frank's GODLESS, in VERY different parts). How Beth pisses them off by being consistently inquisitive, yet they become friends thereafter. And the scene with her first opponent, Annette Packer.\n2. The Cincinnati Open: That moment of uneasiness when Alma asks her about her agent's commission, and how it easily could have gone a different way. Also, when she walks up to her first opponent, and when she mentions her name, he only says \"Oh, shit\". ;)\n3. The speed chess simultaneous against Benny and his followers in New York. Loved the song, loved the scene. Knowing that neither of the actors really knew chess I can only imagine how hard it must have been to memorize and execute those moves. And finally:\n4. The game against Luchenko at the Moscow Invitational. One of the few scenes where the Russian players aren't shown as just robots. His deference in acknowledging Beth's victory, and her replying in kind. \n\nI loved all the more personal, melodramatic moments, too, and especially the early scenes at Methuen, with a wonderful performance by Isla Johnston as young Beth. But the above are the scenes I keep watching over, and over, and over.",

Usually that sort of stuff drags for me, but in this series with the music/ production values and just sheer talent and engagement I could literally watch that all day. \n\nAnd that scene when Harry is just watching her ( I think she's dancing to something...realising how special she is ( and how out of reach).

To anyone who doesn\u2019t know chess is about seeing many movies ahead and takes great brain power. \n\nA sedative or tranquilizer is about as bad of a drug you can take as far as something that takes a lot of brain power. It fogs your mind up greatly. Having addiction issues and mental illness sadly I\u2019ve been on so many of these meds and found a lot of how they handled the drug addiction to be very dated or wrong at any time. I don\u2019t want one person thinking any sort of drug would help them be better at something they want to be good at. \n\nPsychoactive drugs can be awful how they make you feel. Just awful. When you have these issues when your young you figure medicine must have ways to treat you to make you feel better. It\u2019s a tough first few years when you realize how little they have to help with severe depression and anxiety. Which when you can\u2019t get relief from those meds you end up turning to anything that can give relief. \n\nImagine having horrible pain every single day. For years and years. Then one day you take a pill that makes it finally for away and makes it feel like life can be tolerable. That is what it\u2019s like for someone with mental issues who takes certain drugs and finally feels relief. It\u2019s why peole who hate on addicts just for being an addict drives me insane. The stats of how many addicts have mental illness are a large percentage.",

That's usually the **opposite** of what you want when playing chess. *Except maybe* when you're thoughts are already running at 300 mph, because your mom basically took you away from your father, then killed herself, trying to kill you to and you end up in an orphanage, where all your genius and individuality is punished. Then, *maybe*, they help you calm down enough to operate at \"normal\" levels. \n\nAnd envisioning the board is \"normal\" for higher level players. Probably not as vivid as shown, but \"going through the moves in your head\" is basically a must if you want to get anywhere. So no. of course she *isn't* good at chess *because* of the drugs. They just help her \"focus\" until she learns in the end, to do it without them. \n\nHaving not taken any drugs myself, I don't know what message that sends to people who need drugs to simply make it through the day, every day. But I hope they can see the difference in what the story in the show and book is telling and what some idiots want to read into it.",

All those elements are mixed up in her head. \n\nIt's possible your personal experience may not let you see the show and its intentions as presented. If you do another re-watch you'll see how all these points string together especially by the end when Beth realizes she no longer needs the drugs, and has made peace with her memories of the orphanage and Mr. Shaibel. \n\nWe need to take in the information that we are presented without projecting our own personal biases onto it to best understand the story as intended. It could be more enjoyable and fulfilling too.",

In the first episode of the show before she takes the drugs at night, it shows her having flashbacks to her traumatic childhood. In the book, it explains that she can\u2019t fall asleep because she\u2019s hypersensitive to all the noise of the orphanage, i.e. she\u2019s anxious and on high alert all the time.\n\nSo taking the drug calms her mind and allows her to focus on chess and forget about her trauma and anxiety. I\u2019m not sure if sedatives work like that in the real world, but I imagine they can work differently for different people.\n\nI think the ending showed that drugs were a crutch and what she really needed was to know she was loved and accepted. It wasn\u2019t until she realized that all of her friends had her back that she was able to visualize the board without the drugs.",

A game which takes more brain clarity and concentration than almost any known to man. Needing to see 10 moves ahead. Psych meds like that cloud your mind. They don\u2019t let you picture chess boards on the ceiling to play games. I mean that\u2019s like movies showing people on Acid who supposedly see things like they are in a cartoon. Drugs are bad. I think everyone these days has seen how horrible the effects of them are on peoples lives. BTw our prison systems and policing is making the issue worse. If they didn\u2019t crack down so hard addicts wouldn\u2019t have to do more and more crime to get a drug they need. Canada and other countries give heroin addicts heroin! Yes heroin. It\u2019s widely successful and they are able to get and have jobs. The more you crack down on a drug that peole will do no matter what the worse it makes the issue. Like making it harder for heroin to get here so fentanyl is now in every bag of heroin. Killing thousands. Or spice for weed which is so much worse than weed. It\u2019s time to make laws that actually address issues instead of people who benefit in the pockets from decisions like private prisons. Which BTw Biden signed an executive order to not sign any more contracts when theirs are up. So hopefully no more private jails! That would help huge. Put violent people in jail.",

To quote Magnus, \"I know Borgov wants to win, but he's playing like a desperate man.\" It was after this move was played that Townes says, \"He's not doing what he's supposed to do.\" My conclusion is this: Borgov is a master of the end game. He plays like a machine. This was well established. Knowing this, I can safely conclude that Borgov realizes that he cannot win and the best he can do is draw. By playing Ra4 he's basically giving away the game and he knows it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why give away the game? We know Borgov isn't fond of the USSR since we heard the KGB is there to make sure Borgov doesn't run away while in a foreign country. I think Borgov thinks a draw would only serve to further the divide between the people in the USSR and the United States. On the other hand, he realizes that Beth beating him would make international news. She would meet the US president, It would probably spur a lot of world interest in chess. Not only that, if more Americans play chess it could serve to show \"hey, Americans like chess, Russians like chess... maybe we shouldn't blow each other up.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think Borgov thinks he is single handedly saving the world from nuclear destruction, but I do think he intentionally avoids a draw, albeit meaning a loss for himself, because it would help the world wide chess community and ease some of the tension between the Russian and American people by giving them a commonality between them. \n\nThis theme of bonding through chess is then finalized during the last scene of the series when Beth plays chess among the common Russian people and she is celebrated and admired by them, signifying an easing of the tension that was previously established. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think.",

He had already beat her. And she came back stronger. Allowing her to be on equal footing would set up additional matches between the two down the line.\n\nHe would look even better being able to beat someone that was seen as his equal. Which goes right back to his winning mentality. He accepted that a tie would accomplish nothing, but elevating her so he could beat her later would make him seem even better.\n\nI don't know if it was political, as much as just another chess move. It's just a chess move that took place off the board rather than on it.",

        "text": "Some of the differences have been posted before but I am in the part of the story where Jolene re-enters the story. \n\nThe way Jolene comes back into Beth\u2019s life in the book is completely different than the series. I wonder why they changed it?  Beth was really caught in her alcoholism, that much is the same. However, she knew she needed help to get out of it and she called Mrs. Dierdorf at Methuene to get Jolene\u2019s current contact information. Jolene didn\u2019t serendipitously show up. \n\nOne of the things that I love about the story is how accurately it depicts the time it is set in. The fact that Mrs. D could say that Jolene still lived in Lexington and Beth could look the number up either in a phone book, call \u201cinformation\u201d or 411 is something only those of a certain age would remember. \n\nThe whole experience Beth had with Jolene is different than the series, even the stop at Methuene after Mr. Shaibel\u2019s funeral.  It seems the series wanted to present Jolene as a guardian or mother-type figure to Beth, where they were much more like peers in the book. The love and affection was still true, regardless of other things that happened between them in the book.",

I\u2019d at least like to see/hear their phone convo from the book. Jolene pretty much just \u201comg Beth! How are you. U still ugly?\u201d Lol",

I do think that the show left out a lot of his coldness though, and much of Beth's resentment towards him. Book Benny is a bit more stand-offish.",

Not only do Beth and Benny's wardrobes match their respective piece colours, but the lighting does as well. Benny plays black, wears black, and his side of the screen is much darker than Beth's, who is playing white, wearing a light skirt, and is backlit so the floor and walls read much brighter.\n\nI don't know if I'll get around to it but I'd love to draw a couple more of Beth's major matches--particularly her first match against Borgov because the backdrop to that one is GORGEOUS, but I would also love to tackle the lighting in her final match in Moscow.",
